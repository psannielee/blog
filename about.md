	<p class="intro">Hello. Guten Tag. 你好。Hola.</p>
	<p>
		I'm Sannie, a Chinese American that has been living abroad for over ten years with time spent in Germany and 
		in Shanghai, China. Things that may be important for you to know about me:
		<ul>
			<li>
				I like all things tech. I'm a product owner and I am a true believer in working agile. But it needs 
				to work for you.
			</li>
			<li>
				I love music. You'll probably hear me talking about The Beatles, Weezer, OK Go,
				Franz Ferdinand, The Living End, or Frank Turner. I also go to live concerts a lot.
			</li>
			<li>
				I'm passionate about traveling and discovering new cultures. This is likely why I've lived so long abroad.
				It also helps that I like learning (human) languages.
			</li>
			<li>
				I write about pop culture a lot because part of my undergrad major was film & media studies. I think
				pop culture both shapes us and reflects who we are, which is why I like writing about it.
			</li>
			<li>
				I like to read, whether it's books, the newspaper, literary magazines, graphic novels, or Wikipedia. Unfortunately
				I don't have much patience for binge watching series on Netflix.
			</li>
			<li>
				Lastly, I like to cook and eat. I like to cook because I like to eat and I like to eat because I like to cook. You get the idea.
			</li>
		</ul>
