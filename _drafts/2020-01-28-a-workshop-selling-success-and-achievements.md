There's always tons of emails coming through my inbox at work, many of which advertise various events on agility, leadership, personal development, etc. One recently
caught my eye that was called #IAmRemarkable, held by Google, and proclaiming to coach participants on being able to sell your success and achievements better. As a
natural introvert and someone who doesn't like beating my chest about how great I am, I thought it sounded like an interesting chance to do something different.

Looking around the room of about 30 participants, there were only three men. It wasn't surprising that this workshop was so lopsided; in fact, when a coworker and I told
some men in our team that we were at this workshop, they looked at us funny and asked, "Why would you even need a workshop on that?"

One thing that struck me was that the presenter defined "diversity" as "the ratio between men and women." I kid you not. I even wrote it down and underlined it with my own notation: ?!?!?!?!

Before I get into my thoughts on this definition, I'd like to say the workshop itself was refreshing. It was eye-opening to see how different people see why they're remarkable, what do they consider success, and how success can be a personal matter. Of course, it's normal to have measures of success at work that are external, but it's important to have a healthy mix of both. To sum up, the key takeaways were:

1. Speak about your achievements. They won't speak for themselves if you don't.
2. It's not bragging if it's based on facts.
3. Self-promotion is a like a muscle that needs to be trained. The more you use it, the better you'll get.
4. Empowerment and supporting other people are important.

But here's a takeaway I had&mdash;diversity is key to have successful teams because success looks different to everyone. To go back to my main point, it annoyed me greatly that the presenter's definition was so narrow. Even if we're just talking about men and women, there's a whole spectrum there and we're not just binary.

We talked a lot about the struggles that women have promoting themselves, and we touched a little bit upon cultural differences. Some participants are from cultures where self-promotion is frowned upon, so how do you survive in a country like Germany where it's actually expected? I realize that the workshop was only 90 minutes long, so packing it into that amount of time would've been difficult. I think it would've been better to acknowledge this fact and that would've been a legitimate reason to not really discuss it.

But another thing that struck me is that the presenter was able to talk about how difficult it is for her to promote herself, yet, she is a white, heterosexual,
