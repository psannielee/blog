Growing up in suburban New Jersey, I always went on the weekend into New York City to visit my grandparents. My family and I would go out to eat, whether it was dim sum or
picking up some char siu (叉燒, or Cantonese-style barbecued pork) and eating it at someone's apartment. Admittedly I was pretty picky at the time and my favorite thing to eat, no joke, 
was chicken soup and white rice (鸡汤白饭).

I moved to Germany and suddenly realized there were foods I was missing. The amount of authentic Chinese restaurants at the time were seriously lacking, so much so that I wound up
making my own dumplings by hand and seeking out Asian supermarkets. I learned how to cook my own versions of the foods I loved from home. Then I moved to China and discovered
much more about Chinese food; I understood the role of food in Chinese culture better than I had within the context of my family.

After a year in Shanghai, back in Düsseldorf, there were so many more dishes I had learned to love and missed. Similar to when I moved to Germany originally, I started cooking a lot 
more Chinese food and from different regions: Canton, Sichuan, Hunan, Xinjiang. And I realized something else&mdash;Chinese food is a mystery to a lot of people here. I've always
known this, and Chinese food is sort of the Irish pub of food in that it's widely available throughout the world. Yet people adapt it to the local tastes, which can be unique and delicious
on its own, and then the locals don't know what authentic Chinese food *actually* looks or tastes like.

Cooking Chinese food is actually pretty easy when you know what you're doing and if you have a well-stocked pantry. Here are six ingredients that I always have in mine that make it easy
to create a homecooked Chinese meal really easily:

## Soy Sauce (Light and Dark)

Most people are familiar with soy sauce, but I've encountered people that don't realize there's a difference between dark and light varieties.

## Sesame Oil

## Chinkiang Vinegar

## Chilli Oil
