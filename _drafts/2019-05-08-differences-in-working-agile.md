An old coworker sent around Luis Gonçalves' article, ["5 Crazy Reasons Why Agile Does Not Work in Germany,"](https://medium.com/luis-gon%C3%A7alves/5-crazy-reasons-why-agile-does-not-work-in-germany-d692059e5fa6){:target="_blank"} 
which sparked a discussion in an international group of product people who have all worked in Germany. We agreed with a lot of the points and this got me thinking
about how I've experienced agility in two different countries (Germany and China) but have the mindset from a third country (the United States). Although I've never worked
in software development in the US, I think I know enough that I can make a fairly general comparison.

*Cultural Differences Helping (or Hindering Agility)*

The article has five reasons why agile doesn't work in Germany:

1. Hierarchies are too strong for agile to be utilized;
2. The whole society is structured in silos;
3. Infinite years of planning;
4. Everything must be perfect;
5. Very traditional society.

I tend to agree with these general observations and in my experience, these are definitely hinderances to working agile. Points three and four are especially true and 
I've constantly made the comparison as such:

- Germans plan everything from A to Z, but the plan has to be followed linearly, that is, A to B to C and so on. The plan is also followed to a T.
- Chinese people don't really have a plan and think on their feet. It's a lot of chaos, but somehow they make things work out. Yes, historically there were plans,
but seriously, did those plans work out? No. And the people had to figure things out on their own.
- Americans have a plan for everything from A to Z, but unlike Germans, don't follow it linearly and adjust as needed, meaning going from A to W to D and so on.

One particular cultural point that I see being relevant in scrum is diversity in a team and, as a country of immigrants, the United States has a leg up compared to Germany and China. Because
diversity is such an important factor in living in the US, ideas are automatically generated from various backgrounds. Americans are also more aware of these differences and what 
the differences can bring. This also goes into the second point from Gonçalves' article that the whole society is structured in silos. He points out that kids grow up thinking in functional
silos because of the educational system; someone tells you at an early age whether you can study at university or not. Not only that, but silos and labels stick in German society. Ask
someone of non-German heritage who was born here if they are German, and the answer you'll get is likely no. In other words, I am Chinese American, but if I were born in Germany, I would just be "Chinese,"
despite being born in Germany. So yes, German society is structured in silos and I agree that this impacts the agile mindset.

I didn't live long enough in China to have an opinion on silos, but I also worked at a startup founded by foreigners. However, hierarchies do seem to exist and there is a reasonable
expectation that upper management knows what they're doing and can be entrusted to make the decisions. Don't get me wrong; I understand that hierarchies do exist for a reason and someone needs to be responsible
for a business, but I think a key aspect in understanding hierarchies and agility is that management needs to trust everyone under them to do their jobs and make the decisions in which
they are the experts. 

On point three, Germans really do have a knack for infinite years of planning because this leads to the thinking that comes with point four: everything will be perfect if you plan
it in advance. But as we know in agile, things change constantly (to quote a favorite singer of mine: "The only thing certain is that everything changes.")
