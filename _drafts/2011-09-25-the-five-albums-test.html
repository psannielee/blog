If anyone doesn't read the reviews from<a href="www.avclub.com"> A.V. Club</a>, you should.  They're usually insightful and funny, and if you're reading what I write, I find I have the same opinions of many of the A.V. Club's writers. <br /><br />This brings me to Steven Hyden's July 19th article, <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-fivealbums-test,59098/">The Five-Albums Test</a>.  I've been thinking about it a lot recently and to sum it up, Hyden suggests the five-albums test as a rubric to an artist's greatness.  He believes that having five consecutive albums is a truly difficult feat and he writes, "Lots of artists have five or more classic albums (not including EPs or  live records), but the ability to string them together back-to-back  means being in the kind of zone that’s normally associated with dominant  college women’s basketball dynasties."  Amongst the groups that would pass Hyden's test are The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Queen, and Fountains of Wayne.  Yes, you read that correctly, Fountains of Wayne, the group who had that one radio hit "Stacy's Mom."  Moreover, he admits that Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, and Guided By Voices would not pass this test if he looks objectively.<br /><br />I'm not going to go through Hyden's arguments because you can obviously read the article yourself, but I think it makes sense.  Nowadays bands take forever to release material and some don't even stick around long enough to produce five albums.  The Beatles released about two albums <span style="font-style: italic;">per year</span> in 1963, 1964, and 1965 and they were touring to promote the albums.  Granted, <span style="font-style: italic;">With The Beatles</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Beatles for Sale</span> had many covers and the early albums' production time was considerably less than say, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</span>, but even the quality of material that they produced is incredible.  Some may argue that the music industry has changed since The Beatles and yes, that's true.  Bands and performers venture out to do other projects (I'm still waiting for Justin Timberlake to release another album after <span style="font-style: italic;">FutureSex/LoveSounds</span> but it seems acting has gotten in the way of his musical career) and have side bands (how many side projects does Jack White have?)<br /><br />But I think that's what makes the five albums test even more meaningful in this day and age.  It really is something incredible if a band or artist is around long enough to put out enough material for five albums and all five of them are great.  Look at Weezer, one of my favorite bands.  I was surprised with the release of <span style="font-style: italic;">Raditude</span> in 2009 after <span style="font-style: italic;">The Red Album</span> came out only a year earlier, and then <span style="font-style: italic;">Hurley</span> came out in 2010.  But honestly, you can't compare the quality of the three albums to each other, and never mind the comparison to <span style="font-style: italic;">The Blue Album</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Pinkerton</span>.  There are some great songs that if you picked and chose and stuck them together, they would make one really great Weezer album.  But instead, we have three decent albums with a lot of fluff between the best songs.<br /><br />There are bands that I've really liked that put out an album and made me into one of those people that bemoans the passing of the "old stuff," including The Killers (<span style="font-style: italic;">Day &amp; Age</span> was terrible), Garbage (<span style="font-style: italic;">Beautiful Garbage</span> was horribly disappointing after <span style="font-style: italic;">Version 2.0</span> and I didn't even pick up <span style="font-style: italic;">Bleed Like Me</span>), and Flogging Molly (<span style="font-style: italic;">Float</span> didn't feel like Flogging Molly anymore).  I'm always willing to give the bands another shot because there are definitely duds (like The Beatles' <span style="font-style: italic;">Yellow Submarine</span>), but I generally approach them again with caution.<br /><br />However, I think the Five-Albums Test isn't just applicable to music.  I was talking to my sister about TV shows and how they sometimes seem to run forever, even after they've run out of steam.  Shows that are really great have five consecutive seasons that are written and acted well and don't get old.  I'll admit that I'm not a television expert by any means, but I just remember watching shows for about five seasons and then they seemed to go downhill from there, like <span style="font-style: italic;">Scrubs</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Will &amp; Grace</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Friends</span>.  I'm not saying that there aren't individual episodes that are good, but the shows seem to just stop being interesting.  I'm so glad that <span style="font-style: italic;">Lost</span> only had six seasons because seriously, the last season was a bit ridiculous, as was the second or third (I can't remember which one) because they needed to figure out the direction of the show.<br />
