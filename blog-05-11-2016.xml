      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

written since the end of February, but I've actually got very good reason -- I've been studying my tail off for the official Chinese language test, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi"&gt;Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi&lt;/a&gt; 汉语水平考试, better known as the HSK. &amp;nbsp;Although my time in China has been over for almost four months already, I don't want my year there to be for naught. &amp;nbsp;Considering I was more or less a beginner when I first arrived, you could argue that I know I can speak Chinese at a fairly decent level now. &amp;nbsp;However, it was a personal goal of mine to at least reach a solid intermediate level. &amp;nbsp;I even wrote what my goal was in this &lt;a href="http://www.sannielee.com/2015/05/the-inevitable-post-about-learning.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;My goal wasn't ever so concrete that I specifically said I wanted to take a test, but at the same time, it got me to constantly learn every day while not being in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After leaving Shanghai, I kept saying to myself, "Sure, I'll sign up for the HSK," which is only offered here in Düsseldorf twice per year. &amp;nbsp;I handed in my registration the day before it closed, not wanting to wait until the fall to take it. &amp;nbsp;I had been a bit indecisive which level to take, either HSK3 or HSK4. &amp;nbsp;The main difference is the number of vocabulary words that appear (600 vs. 1200, cumulatively) and the grammatical concepts. &amp;nbsp;I decided to take level 3 because I figured I don't actually need the certificate for anything in particular, e.g. studying at a university or for a job. &amp;nbsp;I'm really glad I decided on level 3 because I soon realized there were a lot of gaps in my vocab and grammar that I needed to fill! &amp;nbsp;So here's how I spent the last few weeks studying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BJReFWzYdk4/VxfrlUvSqrI/AAAAAAAAC5I/yP9QVAkjCWANWK2WFvtw06Q23OUq3tdWgCLcB/s1600/WP_20160420_18_12_30_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right:

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h1&gt;The Tools&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;After signing up, there were three things I immediately bought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hefei Huang and Dieter Ziethen's &lt;i&gt;HSK 3 Vorbereitung HSK-Prüfung&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick Study's Mandarin Grammar cheat sheet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick Study's Mandarin Vocabulary cheat sheet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;And there was one additional book that I already owned but used extensively, &lt;i&gt;Tuttle Learning Chinese Characters&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;by Alison Matthews and Laurence Matthews.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I had bought the Huang book for levels 1 and 2 awhile ago and felt they were organized really well. &amp;nbsp;Level 3 is no different, listing all of the necessary vocabulary at the beginning and going through all required grammatical concepts. &amp;nbsp;Lastly, the book has a ton of exercises exactly like the ones on the test. &amp;nbsp;You might be wondering why I didn't buy a book in English, and that's a fair point. &amp;nbsp;However, living in Germany, there's obviously more material available in German and the range of materials is wider. &amp;nbsp;I've also realized when learning languages, making connections between ones I've already learned helps me remember things more easily. &amp;nbsp;For example, when I was first learning German, I kept referring back to concepts that I had learned in Spanish, rather than connecting back to English. &amp;nbsp;I'm sure this doesn't necessarily work for everyone, but for me, it sort of reinforces what I've already learned (if that makes any sense). &amp;nbsp;I could go off on a tangent about learning languages generally, so I'll save that for another blog entry at some point. &amp;nbsp;However, the Matthews book is actually in English, though I mostly used it to see the stroke order and maybe get some tips on how to remember pronunciation. &amp;nbsp;I didn't use it as is suggested since it wasn't my main guide for studying, but I still highly recommend it for learning Chinese characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the two cheat sheets from Quick Study because I had picked up their guide for German grammar when I was learning it and really found it helpful. &amp;nbsp;The sheets just break down necessary concepts in an easy, clear way, though the Mandarin grammar sheet is admittedly much more complicated than the German one. &amp;nbsp;They're good for quick references rather than looking it up in a book and reading everything. &amp;nbsp;Together with the Huang book, reviewing and understanding grammar became a much easier task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h1&gt;The Process&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;As with my undergrad and master's thesis, I counted the number of days I had until the test and then calculated how many words per day I needed to study in order to be in good shape. &amp;nbsp;That wound up being about 20 words per day every day (including weekends!) for five weeks, which left me about a week before the test to really make sure I knew what I was doing. &amp;nbsp;I also always leave a buffer for myself because I know on some days, I just can't reach my goal. &amp;nbsp;It sounds like a lot, and yes, on some days it felt that way. &amp;nbsp;But because there are also a lot of words in the list I already know how to read, write, and use (words like I 我, you 你, is 是, student 学生, eat 吃), some days I could "learn" up to 30 words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eH7BMUduZiM/Vxfl9U-BpxI/AAAAAAAAC48/rHpJPZkE7AUPDCgLre_IoGEvHn2cBpMEwCKgB/s1600/WP_20160420_18_13_36_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right:

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did I actually review vocabulary? &amp;nbsp;Very old school, to say the least. &amp;nbsp;8-year-old me would've cried having to do this, but 30-year-old me is more determined and disciplined -- I wrote every single word multiple times with a pencil and paper. &amp;nbsp;Now, as an 8-year-old, I probably would've had to fill an entire page per word to have it stick, but as a 30-year-old, I don't have time for that. &amp;nbsp;Besides which, rather than using four boxes for one word on grid paper, I used one box per word since my handwriting is now much smaller. &amp;nbsp;For new words, I would essentially take a look at it and see the components that comprise it. &amp;nbsp;One example is the word&amp;nbsp;qí 骑, which means to ride (a bike or horse). &amp;nbsp;I didn't remember encountering this word before, but looking at it, the left side is the radical&amp;nbsp;mǎ 马, which is the word for "horse," a word that I already knew. &amp;nbsp;The right side consists of two words; on top, we have dà 大, which means "big," and on the bottom we have kě 可, which means "can" or "to be able to." &amp;nbsp;Again, these are also two words that I already knew. &amp;nbsp;By putting all three of these words together in my head, I can imagine and remember the word qí 骑 in terms of writing, reading, and knowing its meaning. &amp;nbsp;Pronunciation (i.e. connecting the sound "qí" to 骑) is my weak point and I basically just repeated it in my head over and over again while I wrote it. &amp;nbsp;Some words were easier to remember than others, but being able to read, write, and know its meaning is 75% of the way there. &amp;nbsp;If I didn't actually know any of the components of a word, I'd look up how to write it. &amp;nbsp;The process of physically writing the words usually took between 45 minutes to an hour every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After writing vocabulary, I used my app YiXue Chinese Dictionary to create a list of all the words I needed to know for the HSK3 (quick reminder: I'm a Windows Phone user, and I don't think this app is available on Android or iOS). &amp;nbsp;Before I started writing new ones, I'd review the words from the previous day(s) for about an hour, which basically made vocabulary learning a two-hour affair every day. &amp;nbsp;YiXue has different quizzes with which to study; I basically used the study function to look at the Chinese writing and test myself if I knew how to write it. &amp;nbsp;You can see the character, hide it, write it using your finger, and then make the character appear again to check if you're right or not. &amp;nbsp;I also used the app to go through various timed quizzes like only using the pinyin (romanization) and selecting the corresponding character, or having the English definition and selecting the Chinese character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a

width="180" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after my two-hour writing exercise, I'd spend about 30 minutes reviewing grammar. &amp;nbsp;Knowing the format of the HSK, I knew I didn't need to actually do any grammar-specific exercises like on the Test Deutsch als Fremdsprache (official German language test). &amp;nbsp;The point was more to understand how sentences are structured and recognize various signal words that indicate important information (e.g. passive structure, if something is in the past/present/future, etc). &amp;nbsp;A lot of people who study Chinese say the language doesn't have grammar, which isn't really true. &amp;nbsp;Sure, there are no tenses, no articles, no plurals, and no verb conjugation that plague learning western languages. &amp;nbsp;But there is most definitely word order and lots of words that signal all of the things that are "missing" from European languages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wound up only doing the listening, reading, and writing exercises in the book about two weeks before the actual HSK. &amp;nbsp;I felt confident that my listening comprehension is fairly good, especially compared to other foreigners who haven't lived in China and would also be taking the test. &amp;nbsp;My reading comprehension is also not so bad; my biggest problem is having the patience of reading through a complete sentence. &amp;nbsp;I actually have also been reading short things fairly regularly on WeChat, whether it's people's updates or articles posted (granted, I don't read entire articles, I usually read the first two or three paragraphs before I decide to move on). &amp;nbsp;So again, I wasn't too worried about it. &amp;nbsp;And writing -- I had a fair bit of that just practicing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h1&gt;The Test&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;I took the test five days ago and walking in, I felt a bit nervous. &amp;nbsp;Filling out the answer sheet reminded me of filling out Scantron tests in school. &amp;nbsp;It was almost a flashback to how terrible I was at taking tests in high school, making my mom wait for me for four hours while I took the ACT. &amp;nbsp;But this test was a breeze, only taking an hour and a half of my Saturday afternoon. &amp;nbsp;All of the questions were easier than what I had been practicing in Hefei Huang's book. &amp;nbsp;The only thing that I was a bit skeptical about was the listening comprehension -- it almost sounded as if they had had Siri or Cortana read the test aloud, rather than having actual human beings. &amp;nbsp;Even so, it was very straightforward and much easier to listen to and understand than doing it in Shanghai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I might be saying now that the test itself was quite easy, we'll see how my scores are when they're posted online in five weeks.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/7251348834088095747/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies'

type='html'>It's been almost two months since I left China, but I haven't had time to sit down and really write anything meaningful. To sum up the last two months really quickly, Christian and I left China the day after Christmas because his visa expired on December 31. We flew to Hong Kong where we left all of our suitcases in his company's HK office, then went on vacation for three weeks in Australia. We went to Perth to visit my pen pal, then flew to Sydney (where it rained the whole time we were there), Port Douglas (where we saw the Great Barrier Reef and Daintree National Forest), and Melbourne (where we chilled). We then flew back to Hong Kong, picked up our luggage, and then flew back to Germany on January 20. Then I saw an incredibly cheap airfare home to New Jersey, so after two short weeks in Germany, I flew back home for Chinese New Year for ten days, and then came back to Düsseldorf. This means in the last eight weeks, I've flown over 20,000 miles, which is basically half of the circumference around the world. Whew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-feSZTbYfAQc/VstsCGlB-NI/AAAAAAAAC08/vdaTB4hnz80/s1600/luggage_shanghai.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-feSZTbYfAQc/VstsCGlB-NI/AAAAAAAAC08/vdaTB4hnz80/s1600/luggage_shanghai.jpg" width="95%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;All of the luggage we packed up and brought back to Germany from Shanghai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's finally all sinking in that I've really left Shanghai and I've now had the last eight weeks to really think about life there. Being back in Germany isn't nearly as weird or as big of a struggle as &lt;a href="http://www.sannielee.com/2006/08/reflections-on-year-abroad.html" target="_new"&gt;when I left Berlin and moved back&lt;/a&gt; to Middlebury, Vermont. For one thing, I admire the fact that Düsseldorf is so empty compared to Shanghai and it's just so &lt;i&gt;quiet&lt;/i&gt;. I don't have to worry about getting run over when crossing the street (not like in China, anyway). People don't shout as much. The subway is so quaint -- the new U-bahn line finally opened this weekend after several years under construction and there's a whopping &lt;i&gt;five new stations &lt;/i&gt;that opened this past weekend. Admittedly, I laughed about this because Shanghai opened 22 new stations and a few new lines in one weekend, and that wasn't even the only new station and line openings I experienced in the 15 months I was there. I do realize labor is way cheaper in China, plus the government can basically do whatever it wants there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's funny reading my &lt;a href="http://www.sannielee.com/2006/08/reflections-on-year-abroad.html" target="_new"&gt;reflections on a year abroad&lt;/a&gt; after my year in Berlin. Back then, I said I learned a lot about myself, like that I was more independent than I thought, my academic limits had been pushed, and I was more open to new experiences. After a year in China, it's actually not that much different. Again, I've discovered my independence; instead of academic limits, I was pushed professionally; and being open to more experiences? Duh. To add one more thing to the list that didn't exist in Berlin -- I've learned about myself in terms of identity, but more about that in a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in China and living in Pudong, I didn't really feel like having to go back to the Puxi side of town to socialize. With Christian frequently working late or on business trips, I was left to my own devices. I went to the movies alone, I ate in restaurants by myself, and I went on a few solo trips as well. In order to get to know the city better, I gave myself various day trips to do within Shanghai, whether it was looking for &lt;a href="http://www.sannielee.com/2014/12/discovering-shanghai-via-its-vinyl.html" target="_new"&gt;vinyl shops&lt;/a&gt; or going to find Little Germany in An Ting. Independence in China was of a different sort than in Berlin; this time, I was really doing more stuff alone in a country where I could barely read anything, whereas Berlin was more actually growing up and taking responsibility for things myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professionally, I worked with a team of developers where only one of them spoke a little bit of English; with the rest of the team, I had to learn Chinese fast to communicate with them. In combination with other people giving me &lt;a href="http://www.sannielee.com/2015/05/the-inevitable-post-about-learning.html" target="_new"&gt;weird looks and attitude&lt;/a&gt; that I look Chinese but speak Mandarin at a non-fluent level, having to learn a new language to speak with my team was a great and necessary challenge. My coworkers were all so lovely and helpful with learning the language, whether it was teaching me naughty slang or useful tech vocabulary. And it wasn't that I was just learning Mandarin -- I also was able to improve my CSS skills, get a better understanding of SQL and databases, learn about development in China (hello, WeChat!), and realize what "secure development" means to different companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ3mAZBmF4o/VsttnHwShlI/AAAAAAAAC1E/D1crCkd04s4/s1600/panda_babies.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TJ3mAZBmF4o/VsttnHwShlI/AAAAAAAAC1E/D1crCkd04s4/s320/panda_babies.jpg" width="95%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Panda babies we saw in Chengdu because why not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, the year was full of new experiences which I don't need to delve into since I think they're self-evident (one word: China). But one thing that I had been expecting and can really appreciate was learning about identity and how I see my own. During my master's course, one of the biggest questions that we were always discussing was identity, its creation, and perception, both internally and externally. My relationship with China is a complicated one -- my experience of the country was automatically different from Christian's simply because of what I look like versus what he looks like. Moreover, mainland China at once felt familiar and completely alien, whereas Hong Kong felt familiar and not alien, just displaced. The most familiar things were food, from congee for breakfast to the baked Chinese goods to the simplicity of having a plate of green veggies sautéed in a wok with rice on the side. Other things were hearing classical Chinese pieces I knew from childhood being played on the street or visiting Hangzhou and realizing that all these legends I knew from growing up took place there. But the alien were things like people spitting everywhere, how rude people could be (granted, people can be rude in Chinatown, but actually &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt; in China takes "rude" to a whole new level), and the written language (I had grown up learning traditional instead of simplified).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the year, I also came to understand what things I've learned from my family that are actually more Cantonese than just generally Chinese. One example: during Chinese New Year, all unmarried people are considered "children" and therefore get red envelopes, even from people who are younger than them. This meant that for the one year where I was married and my older sister wasn't yet, I had to give her a red envelope. My coworkers all told me that wasn't a thing, but then I checked with one of Christian's Hong Kong colleagues who confirmed it's definitely more of a Cantonese/Hong Kong thing. Even if I wasn't in the same region from which my family came, I'm more familiar with my family's own customs and traditions and better understand them after living a year in Shanghai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q_i2e-tAtE8/VstwsTdpiaI/AAAAAAAAC1c/TlHIG5z1cw4/s1600/shanghai_smog.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q_i2e-tAtE8/VstwsTdpiaI/AAAAAAAAC1c/TlHIG5z1cw4/s320/shanghai_smog.jpg" width="95%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;A super smoggy view of Lujiazui. This particular night was "hazardous." But I'll never get sick of this view.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get back to identity, I realized how Chinese I am. Eating Chinese breakfast every morning for a week straight? No problem! Grandmother who constantly nags you about something every time you see her ("Ai ya, you've gotten fat/skinny/dark/light/etc!"/"Why don't you have a baby yet?")? Check. Feeling guilty for living far away from your parents? Yup, even if my parents don't even make me feel guilty, it's sort of innate, I guess. But on the other hand, I also realized how American I am. Chinese breakfast, sure, but can I have some eggs and bacon? Great! My reply to my grandmother's nagging? Complain right back at her that she told me the last time I was too fat/skinny/dark/light/etc and there's no way I could ever please her. And dealing with the parental guilt? Well, I'm still abroad and just doing my thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then to make more things complicated, I've also realized how I've gotten accustomed to living in Germany. I'm a pretty straightforward person and express my opinion pretty openly, unlike Chinese people who frequently beat around the bush to say what they're thinking or Americans who sugarcoat their opinions if there's something negative to be said, "That's a great idea, but actually..." And anything not starting on time drives me mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AJMiy3xG4m4/VstvFnl72iI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/spJFIo5HV8s/s1600/pudong_airport.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AJMiy3xG4m4/VstvFnl72iI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/spJFIo5HV8s/s400/pudong_airport.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Good-bye, Shanghai Pudong! Til the next time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Identity is something fluid and ever-changing and this is one thing that became very apparent to me while in China. People can't put me into one box -- am I Chinese? Am I American? Have I been Germanized ("eingedeutscht")? The answer is all of the above. On some days, I felt I could relate well to Chinese people and admired the country's rate of progress; on other days, I raged as an American how the US does things better and on yet other days I would claim that the German way Germans was best. If someone asked me, "But could you go back and live in China?" I think my answer would be yes. I don't think I could live in a smaller Chinese city (like Changsha, where I visited my high school friend Chris), but going back to Shanghai or being in another tier 1 city would be fine. Long-term, I'm not sure I would want to deal with the pollution, traffic, censorship, or hordes of people, but I wouldn't say no to a few extra years there. But for now, it's back to the quiet life in Germany.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/2354235828171631311/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=2354235828171631311&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2354235828171631311'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2354235828171631311'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2016/02/reflections-on-year-abroadagain.html' title='Reflections on a Year Abroad...again.'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-feSZTbYfAQc/VstsCGlB-NI/AAAAAAAAC08/vdaTB4hnz80/s72-c/luggage_shanghai.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-4978313136439347927</id><published>2015-12-06T10:18:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2015-12-06T10:18:15.607+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='movies'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='films'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='chinese'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='china'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cinema'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cultural differences'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='3D'/><title type='text'>Going to the Movies in China</title><content type='html'>A few years ago, I wrote a blog post about &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2012/04/going-to-movies-in-germany.html"&gt;going to the movies in Germany&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I lamented at the fact that there are breaks for long movies and that people don't audibly react whatever they're watching. &amp;nbsp;I also mentioned the fact that movies are either dubbed or not, and you're forced to watch them in 3D. &amp;nbsp;Now that I've been in China for over a year and seen a few movies, it's given me more perspective on seeing movies in the theater here, but it's also made me realize that &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; people watch movies is actually cultural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-urNpxZM-PY8/VmPtaFHPONI/AAAAAAAABuc/_WGITi0-2s4/s1600/cinema.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-urNpxZM-PY8/VmPtaFHPONI/AAAAAAAABuc/_WGITi0-2s4/s320/cinema.jpg" width="95%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Inside my local theater. If you look on the left, you'll see a rose-colored pillar. &amp;nbsp;It's so weird because they can't have anyone sit behind it. &amp;nbsp;Not very well planned out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing to know about seeing movies in China is that there's actually a strict limit on how many movies are imported every year, which is currently set at 34. &amp;nbsp;Then there's the fact that movies need to be approved by censors and even then, movies might be altered in order to comply with restrictions. &amp;nbsp;There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason why certain movies are shown and why others aren't; one good example is that &lt;i&gt;Mockingjay Part 1&lt;/i&gt; wasn't released here at all, but &lt;i&gt;Mockingjay Part 2&lt;/i&gt; was. &amp;nbsp;Piracy is rampant here in China anyway, so even if a movie you want to see is banned, you'll likely find it at your corner pirated DVD shop or you can stream it online somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about foreign movies here in China is that they're not dubbed. &amp;nbsp;All movies have subtitles in Chinese, but even if it's a Chinese movie, subtitles are required anyway due to differences in dialect (written Chinese is the same everywhere). &amp;nbsp;The only time there's a chance that it will be dubbed is if it's a children's movie (I might've panicked and forgotten to check if &lt;i&gt;Inside Out&lt;/i&gt; was in English, but luckily it was).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ticket prices for movies here can widely range, depending on what theater you're going to, if you're buying your ticket online or not, or if it's 3D/IMAX/IMAX 3D/4D (yes, 4D, more on that in a bit). &amp;nbsp;I actually quite like the system here because it's more organized than in Germany. &amp;nbsp;If you buy online or on WeChat, you pay half the price (50 RMB at my theater, so just under $8 USD, instead of 100 RMB) and you print your ticket at the theater from a machine. &amp;nbsp;Snacks are also fairly cheap when comparing them to Germany or the U.S.; a bag of popcorn and two sodas might cost only 40 RMB (about $6.25 USD). &amp;nbsp;Though the downside is that the theater I go to across the street doesn't have salty popcorn; however, they do have other Chinese snacks like dried beef.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CwIwY2Uz5fA/VmPxrhLkmjI/AAAAAAAABu0/dU6-E61gYL8/s1600/3d_glasses.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CwIwY2Uz5fA/VmPxrhLkmjI/AAAAAAAABu0/dU6-E61gYL8/s320/3d_glasses.jpg" width="95%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;China has weird 3D glasses. The ones you get from other cinemas like in Hong Kong or in Germany don't work here. &amp;nbsp;These 3D glasses make me laugh every time because they're so ridiculous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, 4D. &amp;nbsp;That's actually a thing here in China. &amp;nbsp;I thought 4D cinemas were limited to amusement parks (think: Muppets 4D in Disneyworld), but no, they're not. &amp;nbsp;I've actually only seen one movie here in 4D, which was &lt;i&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/i&gt;, and seriously, that was a good one to see in 4D. &amp;nbsp;The chairs shook every time a dinosaur walked by, there was wind, a little bit of water, the usual stuff. &amp;nbsp;But the chairs shaking totally made the movie so much more engaging as if the dinosaur were actually there. &amp;nbsp;OK, I realize I'm a huge nerd, but I actually enjoyed it so much I went to see the movie twice in 4D. &amp;nbsp;When else will I ever be able to do that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;But what about &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; sitting in the movie and how Chinese people react (or not react, in the case of Germans)? &amp;nbsp;To be painfully honest, I actually really don't enjoy going to the movies here in China. &amp;nbsp;Firstly, there's no ratings system here, so people bring their kids to movies, regardless of the content. &amp;nbsp;Even worse, they bring their kids even to really late showings, like at 10 pm. &amp;nbsp;When I saw &lt;i&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/i&gt;, the guy sitting next to me had his six-year-old son with him at a late night show. &amp;nbsp;The kid was freaked out and cried a lot and because it was late, he was also very restless. &amp;nbsp;Heck, the grown woman next to me was crying because she was freaked out by the movie! &amp;nbsp;Eventually the kid actually fell asleep, so that was ok, but why are you bringing such a small child to a late night showing of this particular movie? &amp;nbsp;When I saw &lt;i&gt;Mission:Impossible 5&lt;/i&gt;, again, there were several families with small children. &amp;nbsp;I always ask myself two questions -- 1. Can these kids read the subtitles fast enough (because they likely don't speak English well enough to watch a movie) 2. &amp;nbsp;Do they understand the content or story at all? &amp;nbsp;I still don't have an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVoIIT6MC9o" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Chinese trailer for&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I think Chinese audiences' attention spans are very, very short. &amp;nbsp;This is why only these huge blockbuster action movies seem to be released here. &amp;nbsp;Any slow dramas probably wouldn't do so well; for example, yesterday I saw &lt;i&gt;The Martian&lt;/i&gt; and you could tell the entire audience wasn't really paying attention until the scene where the Chinese space program was shown. &amp;nbsp;The reason why I think this is that people &lt;i&gt;constantly&lt;/i&gt; check their phones for WeChat messages or even just surf online in the middle of the movie. &amp;nbsp;It's extremely distracting to have a glowing screen in your face when your neighbor can't pay attention to the movie. &amp;nbsp;And saying something doesn't solve the problem; your neighbor might put their phone away for a good 20 minutes, but as soon as there's a lull in the action, their phone will come back out. &amp;nbsp;I've also encountered people answering their phones in the middle of the movie and have conversations, not to mention people actually taking pictures of the movie they're watching and uploading it to WeChat. &amp;nbsp;Finally, people continually talk throughout the movie. &amp;nbsp;As I mentioned in my original blog post about movies in Germany, yeah, Americans will make comments, but it's as a reaction to what they're watching. &amp;nbsp;Chinese people actually just talk and it's not as a reaction to the film. &amp;nbsp;They'll talk about everything but the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, going to the movies in China is awesome when they have things like 4D and it's still pretty cheap to go. &amp;nbsp;Admittedly the 3D glasses are weird and annoying and really heavy on your face, but it's not as bad as having people constantly pulling out their phones and checking them. &amp;nbsp;However, I think it's just a cultural difference with what's acceptable behavior or not. &amp;nbsp;It'll be interesting to see how movie-going behavior is in Australia since I've got tickets to see &lt;i&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/i&gt;, though I'm guessing it's more similar to how it is in the States or Germany.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/4978313136439347927/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=4978313136439347927&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4978313136439347927'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4978313136439347927'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2015/12/going-to-movies-in-china.html' title='Going to the Movies in China'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-urNpxZM-PY8/VmPtaFHPONI/AAAAAAAABuc/_WGITi0-2s4/s72-c/cinema.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-4104480342584920449</id><published>2015-11-08T09:18:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2015-11-08T09:23:17.986+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='german'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='germany'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='expatriate'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='american'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='china'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='identity'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cultural differences'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='expat'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='language'/><title type='text'>A Minority Becoming Part of the Majority</title><content type='html'>It's been awhile since I last wrote anything, and there have been times where I thought, "I should write about that." &amp;nbsp;But one particular topic that has come up time and again is my relationship to identity. &amp;nbsp;Being someone that went to a liberal arts college and has always been interested in the notion of identity, whether through media or external forces, living in China has really given me perspective. &amp;nbsp;So let's start at the beginning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uB-wKMad9Ic/Vj8ECxwvi1I/AAAAAAAABuA/PqrJxiGcQjY/s1600/sh_beer_festival.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uB-wKMad9Ic/Vj8ECxwvi1I/AAAAAAAABuA/PqrJxiGcQjY/s400/sh_beer_festival.jpg" width="95%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Let's play a game...where am I? &amp;nbsp;Answer: Just kidding, not in the pic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who knows me, you can probably skip this first part. &amp;nbsp;For anyone who doesn't know me, I'm Chinese American, born and raised in a middle class suburb of New York City that's mostly white. &amp;nbsp;Kids don't realize they're different from each other until someone tells them they're not the same. &amp;nbsp;I grew up thinking I was Jewish and celebrated Chanukah because everyone around me was Jewish. &amp;nbsp;My mom had to sit me down and explain to me that no, our family wasn't Jewish, and no, we didn't celebrate Chanukah (to which my answer was, "So why do I have all these dreidels?" &amp;nbsp;Answer: "Because your friends are Jewish and gave them to you.")**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure when exactly I realized I wasn't like everyone else, i.e. I wasn't white. &amp;nbsp;But I do have some very distinct memories that added up to my realization. &amp;nbsp;In first grade, there was one other Chinese-American girl, but then another one arrived direct from Hong Kong. &amp;nbsp;The teachers assumed we would automatically all be great friends because we were the only Chinese kids, despite the language barrier. &amp;nbsp;The girl from Hong Kong and I did wind up becoming friends, but I really don't think it was because we were both Chinese. &amp;nbsp;Another memory was using my preferred name in school, Sannie, which is a nickname from my Chinese name, instead of my given English name, Patricia. &amp;nbsp;Other kids would make fun of me, saying, "Sunny like the sun!" or "Sony like the TV!" &amp;nbsp;I wound up getting so frustrated that I started using my English name in school so that kids would stop teasing me, even if I didn't and never have really identified with that name. &amp;nbsp;Another formative memory was in fifth grade, a new student from Israel made some fairly racist remark which made me cry. &amp;nbsp;I don't remember exactly what he said, but I recall going to the teacher who had to sit him down and explain to him that that wasn't acceptable. &amp;nbsp;Finally, on my college application, I checked off my ethnicity as being "Asian American." &amp;nbsp;I'm not sure if it helped me get into college or not considering that so many Asian Americans apply to college, but it made me "different" or helped me "stand out."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny thing is, despite growing up and being "different" from the other kids in town, I was also "different" when my parents sent my sister and me to Mandarin school. &amp;nbsp;We were a minority at the school; the majority of kids already spoke Mandarin at home and were just learning how to read and write. &amp;nbsp;My sister and I were learning everything -- speaking, listening, reading, and writing -- because our family speaks Cantonese. &amp;nbsp;Unsurprisingly, we didn't fit in with the other kids, who also usually already knew each other. &amp;nbsp;My mom had to drag me to Chinese school every Saturday for three years until she finally gave up because I cried every time I had to get into the car. &amp;nbsp;Being "different" as a kid is hard, but looking back as an adult, it's obviously made me the person I am now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to the point about being Chinese American in China. &amp;nbsp;It's a topic that has been underlying my entire experience here, from &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2015/05/the-inevitable-post-about-learning.html"&gt;learning the language&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2014/11/job-search-interviewing-adventures-in.html"&gt;looking for a job&lt;/a&gt; to just being in the supermarket. &amp;nbsp;From the outside, I look like everyone else. &amp;nbsp;When I sit on the subway and look around me, I don't stand out. &amp;nbsp;On expat publications, they'll comment about expats giving each other a "knowing look" about, "Well, that's China!" in certain situations. &amp;nbsp;If I give a "knowing look" to a stranger that is clearly not from around here, I'm pretty sure they just think I'm staring at them weirdly or they think I'm just eyeing them because they're obviously not local. &amp;nbsp;Meeting people for the first time is harder than outside Asia. &amp;nbsp;In Germany or the U.S., I'll usually comment, "I'm Asian!" and it's quite easy to find me. &amp;nbsp;Here, I have to actually plan what I'm going to wear and describe myself more than just being Asian. &amp;nbsp;I'll have to describe my height, hair length, what I'm wearing, my accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At concerts in Europe or the U.S., I'm normally one of the very few Asians in the crowd, especially if it's a punk show. &amp;nbsp;I showed a picture from the OK Go show in Shanghai to a friend (which you can see below), and she said she could find Christian more easily than me. &amp;nbsp;"Of course you can, he's white in a sea of Asian faces!" I told her. &amp;nbsp;In the past, I've seen pictures from shows and I could find myself easily because I'm Asian in a sea of white faces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="5" style="background: #FFF;

&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that I may look like everyone here, I'm culturally not the same. &amp;nbsp;For example, many women here aspire to have a child here by the time they're my age; I know several women who don't have kids or are not married and are as old as I am, but they're seen as being outside the cultural norm. &amp;nbsp;They're considered "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_nu"&gt;leftover women&lt;/a&gt;" (剩女), which is a derogatory term used for unmarried women. &amp;nbsp;Generally, people here are more family-oriented; one of my Shanghainese co-workers goes home every weekend to her parents and stays with them. &amp;nbsp;I told her if I had to do that, I'd probably go nuts (sorry, parents!). &amp;nbsp;And overall, I'm much more direct about saying things than any of the local people I know here. &amp;nbsp;I'll tell my boss my honest opinion and question certain things if I don't agree, whereas my local colleagues probably won't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if I have now become a part of the majority based purely on how I look (because it's definitely not how I dress), I still don't feel a part of the majority. &amp;nbsp;The frustration of being "different" and being on the outside is something I've always struggled with growing up, and it's definitely something to which I still give significant thought. &amp;nbsp;Coming to China, I never expected that this would ever go away, but I think the experience living here has made me accept it a little more. &amp;nbsp;I've come to realize that I've got a little bit of everything -- I'm American, I'm Chinese, I'm a little bit European. &amp;nbsp;The best thing about it is that I know I can survive in the U.S., Germany, or China and be more than just OK. &amp;nbsp;And to be perfectly honest, if I actually became a part of a majority where everyone had a similar background as me, I'm not sure how I would react. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;**I wish I could post some pics from school to give you a better idea of the place I grew up with, but after searching Google, I actually couldn't find any school photos. &amp;nbsp;Which made me slightly glad that I grew up in an age where photos weren't ubiquitous and everywhere public. &lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/4104480342584920449/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=4104480342584920449&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4104480342584920449'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4104480342584920449'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2015/11/a-minority-becoming-part-of-majority.html' title='A Minority Becoming Part of the Majority'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uB-wKMad9Ic/Vj8ECxwvi1I/AAAAAAAABuA/PqrJxiGcQjY/s72-c/sh_beer_festival.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-374324264073291221</id><published>2015-08-08T20:34:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2015-08-08T20:39:59.290+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='hong kong'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shanghai'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='germany'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='china'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ok go'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cultural differences'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gigs'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='concerts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='live music'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='pop culture'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shows'/><title type='text'>Cultural Differences at Rock Shows</title><content type='html'>In the past two weeks, Christian and I saw one of my all-time favorite bands, OK Go, in Hong Kong and Shanghai. &amp;nbsp;Seeing them twice in a week made me think about why I sometimes go see bands multiple times on one tour -- even if the setlist is the same, each show is unique because of the crowd. &amp;nbsp;With this in mind, I thought about the fact that I've been to shows in multiple countries -- the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, and now this year, South Korea, Hong Kong, and mainland China (I count HK as being separate from the mainland). &amp;nbsp;So having seen OK Go in four completely different places (the US, Germany, HK, and China), here's a comparison of seeing shows in those places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OdoSznnLQZo/VcY1dzyUywI/AAAAAAAABqo/_uyh2dum7lA/s1600/okgo_sh_show2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OdoSznnLQZo/VcY1dzyUywI/AAAAAAAABqo/_uyh2dum7lA/s400/okgo_sh_show2.jpg" width="95%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;OK Go in Shanghai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. &amp;nbsp;Crowding/Shoving&lt;/h4&gt;Out of the four places, Hong Kong surprisingly seems to be the most respectful of personal space. &amp;nbsp;The people weren't really crowding as much as you would think, and there was definitely enough space that I didn't have to worry about annoying anyone with my bag while dancing. &amp;nbsp;Everyone was so respectful, in fact, that I felt incredibly rude trying to get up front, even though there was space that I could've fit into. &amp;nbsp;Nobody seemed to be squeezing their way up front, whereas in the US and Germany, if there's some space in front of you, most likely someone is going to force their way through to get a better view. &amp;nbsp;Admittedly, I've rudely shoved my way up front at various shows in the US and Germany and probably have pissed some people off, but the point was I didn't feel like it was super rude. &amp;nbsp;My thinking was, if you're going to leave some space open, then let me through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My expectation had been that people in Shanghai would be crowding the whole time because you know, it's China. &amp;nbsp;People are everywhere and don't have any concept of personal space in the subway. &amp;nbsp;But even standing front and center at the show, people were respectful of space and not trying to get in front of me. &amp;nbsp;At a show in the US or Germany, I&amp;nbsp;quite frequently&amp;nbsp;find myself gripping the barrier, lest I lose my coveted spot to someone who thinks they can get by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. &amp;nbsp;Security&lt;/h4&gt;In the US and Germany, security is quite the issue and the majority of time, you have to open your bag and probably get patted down. &amp;nbsp;Although I would think the US would be strictest, my feeling is that Germany is more so. &amp;nbsp;One show I went to wouldn't even let me keep my studded belt on, so I was forced to leave it at the entrance and hope that I could retrieve it at the end of the night (unsurprisingly, it wasn't there). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In both Hong Kong and Shanghai, there was absolutely no security whatsoever. &amp;nbsp;No pat down, no showing what was inside your bag. &amp;nbsp;Theoretically you could bring in drinks, including beer bottles, which is never allowed in the States or Germany. &amp;nbsp;I didn't feel unsafe or anything, but it felt a bit wrong to just walk into the venue without having to at least open my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N1gh6ZP03fE/VcY6UWFT6HI/AAAAAAAABrM/x9_ZnFak_00/s1600/okgo_hk_show1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Lead singer Damian Kulash getting the HK crowd to sing "This Too Shall Pass"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. &amp;nbsp;Taking pictures&lt;/h4&gt;It's a stereotype that Asians love taking pictures, and this stereotype holds true at shows. &amp;nbsp;I'll admit that I love taking photos at shows and probably take too many in the hope of getting that one perfect shot, though I try to keep out of other people's line of sight. &amp;nbsp;There's nothing more annoying than having someone's phone in front of your face the whole time. &amp;nbsp;At the OK Go show in Hong Kong, when lead singer Damian Kulash came out to the crowd to play the acoustic song "Last Leaf," he actually sort of laughed and commented on the fact that everyone was so tech-savvy, a.k.a. everyone had their phones out and had them in his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Shanghai takes the cake on taking pictures. &amp;nbsp;Although Hong Kong also had no security, fans in Shanghai brought multiple cameras with them and they weren't just limited to smartphones or tablets (ugh). &amp;nbsp;I saw people with professional-looking DSLRs and point &amp;amp; shoot cameras. &amp;nbsp;And unfortunately, there were quite a number of people with the dreaded selfie stick. &amp;nbsp;So basically everyone was taking pictures the whole time with multiple cameras, smartphones, and tablets. &amp;nbsp;I was so happy that we got to the show early and were in the first row front and center, otherwise dealing with selfie sticks and tablets would've really put a damper on the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. &amp;nbsp;Smoking&lt;/h4&gt;In recent years, both Germany and the US have cut down on smoking in public places, including in concert venues. &amp;nbsp;In the US, you won't get as many people disregarding rules and smoking either cigarettes or weed as in Germany, but both places, you'll definitely have some smokers. &amp;nbsp;Here in China and to a lesser extent in Hong Kong, smoking is still allowed in public places. &amp;nbsp;It's not uncommon in Shanghai to be at a local Chinese restaurant and the table next to you is full of men chain-smoking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, I found it surprising that there was basically nobody smoking at both Hong Kong and Shanghai shows. &amp;nbsp;In Shanghai, I might not have noticed because I was so far up front, but in Hong Kong, I was more towards the middle and nobody was really smoking. &amp;nbsp;So even if you wanted to smell like you've been to a concert (i.e. smoky and alcohol-drenched), you couldn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4ze0KRlR0Kc/VcY8P0hajJI/AAAAAAAABrU/pcTeq9vrvbM/s1600/okgo_sh_show3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4ze0KRlR0Kc/VcY8P0hajJI/AAAAAAAABrU/pcTeq9vrvbM/s400/okgo_sh_show3.jpg" width="95%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;OK Go covering Led Zeppelin's "Black Dog" in Shanghai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. &amp;nbsp;Alcohol + drinking beverages in general&lt;/h4&gt;The strictest place when it comes to alcohol seems to be Hong Kong, as absolutely no alcohol was allowed in the venue. &amp;nbsp;I saw some foreigners who probably just brought in beer cans due to the lack of security, but there was also nowhere to buy anything to drink, even just water or a soda. &amp;nbsp;Of course, this could be limited to the venue I was at, but it was a bit weird to be at a show and not be able to buy anything to drink considering it was pretty hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, the venue in Shanghai had a bar in the actual room where the band played and it sold beer and cocktails. &amp;nbsp;I found it particularly surprising that the beer wasn't poured into a plastic cup, but it was actually served &lt;i&gt;in the glass bottle&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;In both Germany and the US if drinks are allowed, it's always served in a plastic cup out of fear that someone will just chuck it into the crowd (I can't even count the number of times I've been hit in the head by a cup or gotten covered in beer from someone throwing one). &amp;nbsp;Although the Shanghai show allowed alcohol, the majority of people weren't ridiculously drunk like I've seen in the western world. &amp;nbsp;In fact, the only person who was plastered was a Brit (go figure, I guess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. &amp;nbsp;Cheering/clapping/making noise&lt;/h4&gt;The stereotype is that Americans are loud and the older I get, the more I realize this is kind of true, though at a rock show, this makes for a pretty damn good time. &amp;nbsp;Americans love to cheer the band and shout things (ok, maybe Americans also heckle a little bit). Germans love to clap in rhythm to any song, as do people in Hong Kong and Shanghai. &amp;nbsp;And when the band leaves the stage and there's that break before they come back on stage, Americans definitely win for being the rowdiest, but also, in my opinion, the most fun. &amp;nbsp;People will shout and cheer and whistle and there's never any silence. &amp;nbsp;Shows in Germany, Hong Kong, and Shanghai had a lull where people just seemed kind of tired of cheering. &amp;nbsp;And actually, this isn't limited to just that break before the encore, but also after songs were done and the band was getting ready to play the next one. &amp;nbsp;I remember one time in Cologne when Chris Cheney, lead singer of the Living End, actually commented on it and seemed surprised at how quiet it got. &amp;nbsp;But in Hong Kong, it definitely got even quieter, which for me, as someone who loves making noise at shows seemed a bit awkward (see, I am sometimes still very American). &amp;nbsp;One other thing I noticed was that in Hong Kong, people actually stomp their feet instead of clapping, whistling, or cheering before the encore, which people elsewhere don't really do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WUi8u-36icY/VcZJmSnLJnI/AAAAAAAABr8/TfgDzdRelBQ/s1600/okgo_sh_tickets.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WUi8u-36icY/VcZJmSnLJnI/AAAAAAAABr8/TfgDzdRelBQ/s320/okgo_sh_tickets.jpg" width="180" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;The tickets for the Shanghai show before they got torn in half for entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;7. &amp;nbsp;Ticketing&lt;/h4&gt;I've always loved saving my tickets from every single show I've ever been to, and in my opinion, it's almost a requirement going to a concert. &amp;nbsp;In Germany, they've even started to print tickets with the band or some artwork from the latest album on them to make it more like a souvenir (I'm not sure if they've started doing this in the States). &amp;nbsp;You can also buy tickets online in the US or Germany and you usually have to print it out yourself, but I'll pay the extra fees to get a physical ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Hong Kong and Shanghai, I bought my tickets online and didn't have to print anything, unlike in the west. &amp;nbsp;For the show in Hong Kong, I was sent a PDF with a QR code which I saved on my phone. &amp;nbsp;At the venue, I just had to open the document and have the people scan it, which felt a bit odd because I always check 10 million times that I haven't forgotten/lost my ticket. &amp;nbsp;Admittedly, I checked my phone 10 million times to make sure it had enough battery before going in. &amp;nbsp;In Shanghai, I also ordered my tickets online and was sent an SMS telling me that I could pick up my "e-tickets" before the show. &amp;nbsp;When I went to pick them up, there was just a table set up with a dinky sign. &amp;nbsp;And the tickets themselves? &amp;nbsp;They were just regular pieces of paper printed out from a regular printer with a stamp on it. &amp;nbsp;At the entrance, they just tore it in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, at the end of the Hong Kong show, there were posters handed out to everyone as they exited which were made specifically for the Hong Kong date. &amp;nbsp;I thought that was pretty cool and a good substitute for a ticket, and it's actually something I might frame and hang up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;8. &amp;nbsp;Dancing&lt;/h4&gt;Far and away, Americans love dancing/rocking out the most when I compare shows, followed by those in Germany. &amp;nbsp;Hong Kong people danced the least, which I found a bit disappointing. &amp;nbsp;I'll dance regardless if nobody else is, but it makes for much more fun when the crowd gets into it. &amp;nbsp;I really don't care if people give me weird looks or find it annoying -- there's music, and as Frank Turner sang, I want to dance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how much people in Shanghai moved as I thought they would be more reserved than Hong Kong, but that wasn't the case. &amp;nbsp;In fact, Damian actually even invited people up on stage to dance during the last song, "Here It Goes Again," and people (including myself!) were happy to oblige. &amp;nbsp;He didn't do this in Hong Kong, which just proves why going to multiple shows on the same tour is totally worth it. &amp;nbsp;I certainly wouldn't have predicted that that would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UkX2liEoHaU/VcY9mO6XpAI/AAAAAAAABrk/wGRJXKOXv_Y/s1600/okgo_sh_show4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UkX2liEoHaU/VcY9mO6XpAI/AAAAAAAABrk/wGRJXKOXv_Y/s400/okgo_sh_show4.jpg" width="95%" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: left;"&gt;Even sites that I regularly read that aren't blocked (AV Club, Consequence of Sound, Pledgemusic), are so slow without the VPN that sometimes I wonder if they've been added to the blacklist. &amp;nbsp;And then a few months ago, there was a case that any website that seemed to have any Facebook code (whether it was just a like button or the option to sign in with Facebook) was redirecting to wpkg.org. &amp;nbsp;There was a discussion about whether this was part of the Great Cannon, another tool from Chinese censors that basically takes traffic and redirects it to a specific website, bombarding it with a ton of traffic to eventually make the site crash. &amp;nbsp;(I'm not getting into the specifics, but CNN describes it a little better than I do &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/04/opinions/china-great-cannon/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Working at a startup, it's been interesting learning to deal with poor Chinese internet. &amp;nbsp;For starters, our email is actually on Gmail, which means that if we want to read any email, we have to turn on a VPN. &amp;nbsp;Part of the company is also actually in Malaysia and India, so when we develop sites for these markets, we still need to have these sites available with Facebook login. &amp;nbsp;It can be challenging doing any sort of testing and quite often, I'll actually message the Malaysian team members to check something and ask, "Is the page &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; slow/broken/whatever, or is it because of my crappy Chinese internet?" &amp;nbsp;Trying to do any sort of video/phone-conferencing with Skype or GoToMeeting (forget about Google Hangouts) is also nearly impossible because the connection is so terrible you can't hear what the other side is saying. &amp;nbsp;Most of the time, it's easier just to have a regular phone call. &amp;nbsp;Even if I use Skype to call in to a conference on a landline, it's still difficult to discern what's being said.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;As much as it is incredibly frustrating that internet here is different than the rest of the world, it has also created its own unique environment that people can get around if they're determined. &amp;nbsp;One example is "collateral freedom," the idea that information should be hosted on encrypted services deemed too critical to block (like Amazon Web Services), so that people can get information they need. &amp;nbsp;For Chinese censors to block an entire domain from AWS would be a bit much, which is why collateral freedom works. &amp;nbsp;On the other hand, the question is if the average Chinese user even cares, since there are many services/websites that do what all these blocked services do but cater to the Chinese market.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;I've always been a proponent of net neutrality and living in China has made me even more so. &amp;nbsp;Anything hosted within China is significantly faster than anything hosted outside of China (reason being: easier to censor/control), and it's frustrating that I can't even access my email without turning on a VPN. &amp;nbsp;Sure, it's made me realize that I'm very dependent on Google's services and one could argue that I could find a Chinese substitute. &amp;nbsp;However, the choice should be my own and not one that's been forced on me. &amp;nbsp;Not only that, but the Chinese substitute isn't even a substitute because the products' quality is so bad. &amp;nbsp;On Baidu, Chinese's biggest search engine, I tried searching for "translator" in English hoping that it would give me the Baidu English/Chinese translator. &amp;nbsp;These were the top five results I got:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UPYkPVHEXUM/Vbw1Da6mHpI/AAAAAAAABqI/vtYqtQg-AfU/s1600/baidu_translator.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;If you look, you'll see that Google Translate is the first hit, followed by Bing, some random website, and then finally, the Baidu translator. &amp;nbsp;And the Baidu translator search result isn't actually even for an on-site translator, it's for an Android app. &amp;nbsp;It makes absolutely no sense to me that the first hit is Google Translate when all Google services are blocked to begin with! &amp;nbsp;So this is the reason why I don't use Baidu or other Chinese services -- they're not substitutes because their quality is far inferior to Google and even Bing (which thankfully isn't blocked).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;I guess the basic conclusion about life behind the Great Firewall is this -- if you're a westerner that needs a digital detox, come to China without a VPN. &amp;nbsp;And for me, the lack of freedom online even with using a VPN is one major reason why I'm not sure I would want to stay in China long-term.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/5605132339191427950/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=5605132339191427950&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5605132339191427950'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5605132339191427950'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2015/08/life-behind-great-firewall.html' title='Life Behind the Great Firewall'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ho1lqfiq1Dk/Vbwqvak4wHI/AAAAAAAABp0/OmKNmDlYglQ/s72-c/unavailable_page.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-6997798632430728614</id><published>2015-07-12T11:01:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2015-07-13T15:04:38.241+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='tech'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='technology'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='china'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cultural differences'/><title type='text'>Working in a Chinese office -- cultural + development differences</title><content type='html'>I've just recently reached the seven-month mark working here in Shanghai. &amp;nbsp;The company that I'm at was actually founded here by an Indian and an American, but the majority of my coworkers are Chinese (although we also have an office in Kuala Lumpur and one in Mumbai). &amp;nbsp;We're only a team of about 20 people in the Shanghai office, so comparing work styles between a Chinese, German, and American company isn't really possible since the other jobs I've had were at bigger companies. &amp;nbsp;However, there are a few things I've discovered working in China, and if you know me, I love lists. &amp;nbsp;So here are five things I've noticed about working in the Middle Kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q119_KBL_7Y/VaIZegKHcOI/AAAAAAAABoo/G1oipEeDmcc/s1600/WP_20150530_13_22_01_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="225" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q119_KBL_7Y/VaIZegKHcOI/AAAAAAAABoo/G1oipEeDmcc/s400/WP_20150530_13_22_01_Pro.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Pictures of the office are boring. So here's a picture from Hangzhou's West Lake instead.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. &amp;nbsp;The water dispenser&lt;/h3&gt;Every office here in China has a water dispenser/water cooler. &amp;nbsp;Except it's not really a water cooler by any means. &amp;nbsp;In the United States, the water cooler actually cools water so that you'll get a nice glass of cold water, something you'd like to drink on a hot summer day, whether or not it's the summer. &amp;nbsp;Here in China, it's really more of a water heater dispenser. &amp;nbsp;There are two options for water: room temperature which is "cold" water 冷水 (not "ice" water 冰水, which is what Americans like to drink) and hot water 热水. &amp;nbsp;The hot water is practical for making tea, instant coffee, or even ramen very quickly, but the room temperature water just doesn't do it for me, especially since the really hot summer weather is upon us. &amp;nbsp;Usually I'll let my room temperature water sit a bit and it'll actually get colder because the air conditioning is on so high. &amp;nbsp;Also people here drink hot water plain. &amp;nbsp;I knew that before I came here since my dad and grandparents do that, but I know non-Chinese people think it to be super bizarre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. &amp;nbsp;The afternoon power nap&lt;/h3&gt;At my last job in Germany which was at a fairly big tech company, I would always joke about taking a nap on one of the big bean bag chairs that was ubiquitous around the office. &amp;nbsp;But that's all it ever was -- a joke. &amp;nbsp;I wouldn't &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; ever take a nap there because, well, it'd be a bit odd (though I'm sure everyone in the office would just shrug and be ok with it or play a practical joke).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, here in China, it's very common to take a power nap after you eat lunch. &amp;nbsp;The term is "xiūxí" 休息, or "to rest." &amp;nbsp;My coworkers will usually sit at their desks and lean forward, resting their heads on their arms. &amp;nbsp;Some of them actually have pillows that they'll put on their desks and just slump over onto them without having their arms to lean on. &amp;nbsp;Each person's nap differs in length, though there are a few who don't really do it. &amp;nbsp;When I told my Chinese teacher that I don't power nap after lunch, she looked at me appalled, asking, "So, you just eat lunch, and then continue working?!" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure if this helps productivity or not, but if I did power nap, I'd probably take it later in the day during my afternoon slump. &amp;nbsp;Then again, if I took a nap, who knows if I'd actually wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And generally, people are &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; good at power-napping here. &amp;nbsp;Here's two pics of people sleeping on the train, in addition to the ones I posted in February (because I take pictures of everyone on the train since there's not much else to do when you're riding it every day for 45 minutes one way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Power-napping on the train, huzzah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. &amp;nbsp;Personal hygiene in the office&lt;/h3&gt;Back in February, I mentioned how people do &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2015/02/pictures-are-worth-1000-words.html"&gt;gross things in the subway&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I had a picture of a guy clipping his fingernails in the subway, and guess what, it doesn't end on public transportation. &amp;nbsp;I have a few colleagues who do this in the office as well. &amp;nbsp;I talked to two of my coworkers who aren't from China, and I realized that I'm not the only one who finds it a bit disgusting. &amp;nbsp;So now every time I hear that awful noise, I look up at these coworkers with this reaction:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b34GoTaeqRI/VaISL_Z5N2I/AAAAAAAABoM/BL__K6fN5f0/s1600/scared-cat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="218" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b34GoTaeqRI/VaISL_Z5N2I/AAAAAAAABoM/BL__K6fN5f0/s320/scared-cat.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've talked to Christian about this, and he's also said people clip their nails in his office too. &amp;nbsp;So it's not just in my office. &amp;nbsp;I guess at least I should be thankful that they're clipping their nails over the garbage can and not just letting it fly every which way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. &amp;nbsp;Developing in Chinese isn't nearly as awful as I had expected&lt;/h3&gt;Working together with developers whose English is at a very basic level can be challenging, but at the same time, if we are discussing technical stuff, speaking in Chinglish gets the point across both ways. &amp;nbsp;Luckily so much of development is in English, so by just pointing at something and using very basic works, like, "That's not right," or "That's ok," we can work together pretty well. &amp;nbsp;I've learned specific terms, though sometimes it's just easier for me to fix the code myself (especially if it's front-end related) or just show a screenshot. &amp;nbsp;On occasion, there are things that are a bit more complex that I'll have to ask another colleague to translate for me. &amp;nbsp;The problem here is that the colleagues who speak English well don't really know technical terms at all in English or Chinese. &amp;nbsp;Luckily, these situations aren't so common, but it's a learning experience for everyone involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. &amp;nbsp;Developing for the Chinese market is a completely different ballgame&lt;/h3&gt;Currently, one of our main projects is developing a WeChat app. &amp;nbsp;I've mentioned WeChat several times before, but to reiterate, WeChat is a social network/messaging app that has a lot of other really cool, convenient features. &amp;nbsp;It's enormously popular and you can't get away from it. &amp;nbsp;On a side note, I actually prefer WeChat to WhatsApp or Facebook messenger (which I've actually removed from my phone because I hate it that much and it's useless in China anyway). &amp;nbsp;One of WeChat's interesting features is that if you tap on a link that someone's sent you in a private message or someone posted on their Moments (basically like the Newsfeed on Facebook), the link will open in the in-app browser. &amp;nbsp;And the WeChat browser doesn't behave anything like other browsers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day, two other colleagues and I were testing our WeChat app on three different platforms -- iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. &amp;nbsp;As a WP user, I've sort of unfortunately gotten used to things not looking quite as nice as on an iPhone. &amp;nbsp;But the number of bugs and differences I had on WP in WeChat basically made the head developer want to cry. &amp;nbsp;He looked my phone and was like, "What is that?!" &amp;nbsp;WP only commands about 7% of the market here in China, but even so, that's a few million people, which makes it hard to completely ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, we've skipped making a responsive website and gone directly to making something WeChat-optimized, which actually isn't that uncommon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8yAT5Xfb8j4/VaIZdZiQ6vI/AAAAAAAABok/4nDBpz90ask/s1600/wp_ss_20150712_0001.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8yAT5Xfb8j4/VaIZdZiQ6vI/AAAAAAAABok/4nDBpz90ask/s320/wp_ss_20150712_0001.png" width="192" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align: start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;The Time Out Shanghai WeChat app, which basically is their website made easier to navigate in WeChat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;All in all, working in China has so far been educational, both in terms of development (tech-wise) and learning the language. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes I miss being able to explain something clearly in either English or German, though at times I struggle to express myself just in English because German just comes out. &amp;nbsp;So it's things like that that are part of my daily work life. &amp;nbsp;I wonder what will happen when/if I ever move back to the States or Germany how things will be at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 7/13/15 - I forgot to mention working in a Chinese office and the BATHROOM. &amp;nbsp;God, the bathroom. &amp;nbsp;A lot of places here don't have plumbing like in the west. &amp;nbsp;So instead of flushing the toilet paper down with everything else, you have to put the toilet paper in the garbage can NEXT to the toilet. &amp;nbsp;It's something I really loathe a lot and find it pretty gross. &amp;nbsp;Not only that, there are sometimes squat toilets in offices. &amp;nbsp;I've seen women go into them voluntarily, to which I will say, "No, thank you." &amp;nbsp;And I'm pretty sure that if there's no squat toilet, some women will put the toilet seat up and squat &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;on the toilet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Like, the regular seated toilet that's a standard in the west. &amp;nbsp;Kind of like &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3043331/Chinese-passenger-hospitalised-airport-toilet-COLLAPSED-squatted-not-clean.html"&gt;this guy where the toilet collapsed under him and he was injured&lt;/a&gt;

before actually arriving in Shanghai, and it can't be stressed enough how true it is (except substitute Japanese for Chinese), even if the video presents the situation in an amusing light:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="align: center;"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe align="center" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLt5qSm9U80" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After starting my job, I immediately signed up for private Mandarin classes. &amp;nbsp;It might seem a bit decadent, but I've realized why I never improved. &amp;nbsp;Back in Germany, I took a beginner's class at the university while doing my master's. &amp;nbsp;It was a great opportunity to dust off what I had learned in Chinese school as a kid, but the class was only once a week for an hour and a half; the other twelve students in the class were true beginners, whereas I wasn't really. &amp;nbsp;A few years later, I decided to sign up for lessons at the Confucius Institute, the Chinese equivalent of the Goethe Institute, Instituto Cervantes, or Institut Français. &amp;nbsp;However, I wasn't advanced enough to get into the intermediate class, so I was put into the beginner's class. &amp;nbsp;Again. &amp;nbsp;It came down to the fact that I could tell you basic information like my name and where I'm from, could count to 999, and could do basic haggling. &amp;nbsp;Beyond that, I hadn't learned anything else like colors or talking about the weather because I continually got put into the beginner's class, where it was starting from the very beginning -- learning what the hell pinyin is (the romanization of Chinese), the four different tones, and how to introduce yourself with the most basic information. &amp;nbsp;Hence choosing to take a private class where I could just tell the teacher, "I know how to say all this," and learn at my own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I'm almost halfway through my first class of 100 hours. &amp;nbsp;I go to class twice a week before work for two hours at a time. &amp;nbsp;Doing a private class was a really good decision because I'm already done with the first book, for which some people need a whole year. &amp;nbsp;Moreover, my teacher is actually teaching me the actual characters and not just pinyin. &amp;nbsp;This means rather than learning, "Xiànzài wǒ xuéxí hànyǔ" where the weird little strokes indicate the tone, I'm learning it as "现在我学习汉语" ("I'm studying Chinese now").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to read or recognize characters (which I had had from Chinese school way back when) has been a distinct advantage learning the language. &amp;nbsp;There are so many characters that have the same pronunciation, like "ma" could be 吗 (question particle) or 妈 (mother) or 马 (horse), &amp;nbsp;all with different tones, but then you also see that they all have 马 in the characters themselves. &amp;nbsp;This means that I've actually been able to make connections between words, which makes it much easier to remember rather than just a single tone ("ma") that is meaningless on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NDvmwz66jJk/VWB8cEJHykI/AAAAAAAABmw/IST0A2t_Cro/s1600/chinese_homework.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NDvmwz66jJk/VWB8cEJHykI/AAAAAAAABmw/IST0A2t_Cro/s400/chinese_homework.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Chinese homework, yessss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, my pronunciation is also influenced by the fact that my family speaks Cantonese. &amp;nbsp;There are certain common words that I just can't say properly in Mandarin, like péngyǒu (朋友 friend), dàngāo (蛋糕 cake), kāfēi (咖啡 coffee), and niú (牛 cow) and I struggle every time I need to say them. &amp;nbsp;I've had people actually assume that I'm from Hong Kong based on my pronunciation, which I find hilarious, especially because the last time I was in Hong Kong, I talked to the cab driver in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also been amusing to see where and what kind of vocabulary I've been learning. &amp;nbsp;In class, I learn everyday words: colors, business-related stuff, sports, foods, numbers over 999*. &amp;nbsp;At work, I've learned a lot of technical words, like task, upload, update, database, website, webpage. &amp;nbsp;And then there's slang I pick up randomly from people or by being able to read ads, stuff on WeChat, and watching TV. &amp;nbsp;This last bit is actually the most hilarious because when I tell my coworkers what I know, they end up laughing their asses off and wondering why I know that, which then prompts them to teach me even more. &amp;nbsp;It's as if I'm a child that amuses them greatly, which is fine by me because at least I'm trying to use what I learn. &amp;nbsp;More importantly, they see that I'm making the effort to communicate with them in their language, which then makes them more comfortable trying to use English when talking to me. &amp;nbsp;It's one big learning group, people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uOpGbfpXhEY/VWCDXE36y2I/AAAAAAAABnA/ZkJ1-OpkBUM/s1600/qibao.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uOpGbfpXhEY/VWCDXE36y2I/AAAAAAAABnA/ZkJ1-OpkBUM/s400/qibao.jpg" width="575" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Qibao, a water town in Shanghai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to return to the point about being Chinese and not being able to speak Chinese, it's mostly frustrating, can be challenging, but at the same time, motivating. &amp;nbsp;It's frustrating because people really just do not understand why my Chinese is not fluent (especially when I'm with people who are white and speak perfectly fluently) and challenging because getting looks like there's something wrong with me is something I just need to get over. &amp;nbsp;It should be their problem and not mine that they don't understand that. &amp;nbsp;But even with being exasperated the majority of the time, this attitude is actually motivating because of the fact that there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; an expectation that I can speak the language. &amp;nbsp;For Christian, he's white, and there's no expectation that he can speak the language, so people readily accept the fact that they will have difficulty understanding him. &amp;nbsp;He can just smile and try to communicate, and if he doesn't learn Chinese, he's a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laowai"&gt;laowai 老外&lt;/a&gt; (foreigner), so it doesn't matter. &amp;nbsp;I guess it's kind of the opposite of learning German, where it was motivating to pleasantly surprise people that I can speak it. &amp;nbsp;It's motivating to learn Chinese&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of that expectation, if that makes any sense whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six months in, I'm now able to search online for things, book flights and hotels online, can communicate what I want to order better in a restaurant, tell the developers very basically what I need them to do, do a daily scrum, and have a basic conversation in Chinese. &amp;nbsp;My goal in another six months is to be able to have more than a basic conversation, be able to read more advertisements in the subway, and to order what I want not just by saying, "I'd like to have one portion of this," and pointing to it on the menu. &amp;nbsp;And now that I've basically announced my goal to everyone, I need to hold myself to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;*As a small tangent, wtf, Chinese, you win for weirdest way to say numbers when they're really large. &amp;nbsp;The number 14,050,910 is basically said "one thousand four hundred zero five ten-thousand, nine hundred ten" so that it's broken down as such: 14050 910 Yīqiān sìbǎi líng wǔ wàn jiǔbǎi yīshí 一千四百零五万九百一十. Even if German is weird and says "nine-and-twenty"/"neunundzwanzig" for 29, at least it still breaks down numbers in groups of threes so that's still vierzehnmillionenfünfzigtausendneunhundertzehn (basically how we say it in English).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;**I'd also just like to mention, this is apparently my 100th post.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/8553144309206300876/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=8553144309206300876&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/8553144309206300876'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/8553144309206300876'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2015/05/the-inevitable-post-about-learning.html' title='The Inevitable Post about Learning Chinese'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://img.youtube.com/vi/oLt5qSm9U80/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-1172503033008102080</id><published>2015-04-19T16:00:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2015-04-20T15:24:18.159+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='german'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='chinese'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='germany'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='languages'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='expatriate'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='china'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='immigrant'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='immigration'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='expat'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='language'/><title type='text'>Differences Between Expats &amp; Immigrants</title><content type='html'>Ever since I arrived here in Shanghai, I noticed there's a huge expat community here. &amp;nbsp;The magazines &lt;a href="http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/"&gt;TimeOut Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cityweekend.com.cn/shanghai/"&gt;City Weekend&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are every expat's guide to the city; they review restaurants, put up the latest happenings, list events, and so on, all in English. &amp;nbsp;One common thread that pops up regularly is how the expat community is in a constant state of flux, mostly because people continually come and go. &amp;nbsp;This got me thinking about the differences in the terms "expat" and "immigrant."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I renamed this blog "Expat Hoch Zwei," which is the English term "expat" mixed with "hoch zwei," which in German means "squared." &amp;nbsp;Expat squared because I was an American living in Germany who moved to China. &amp;nbsp;But am I really an expat squared? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oxford Dictionary defines each as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;expatriate&lt;/b&gt; (noun) - a person who lives outside their native country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;immigrant &lt;/b&gt;(noun) - a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c5ghRsj9ISM/VTOyLs_ii8I/AAAAAAAABls/SQhvGf6X4BU/s1600/zhangjiajie1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c5ghRsj9ISM/VTOyLs_ii8I/AAAAAAAABls/SQhvGf6X4BU/s1600/zhangjiajie1.jpg" width="575" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;I don't have images that would go well with this topic. &amp;nbsp;So here's an image from Zhangjiajie I took.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on these definitions, then, an immigrant is also an expatriate, but an expatriate is not necessarily an immigrant. &amp;nbsp;It's the permanence that sets the two apart. &amp;nbsp;In my experience, "expat" generally has a romantic flair about it and expats can leave whenever they want. &amp;nbsp;It's obvious here in Shanghai that the expat community is exactly that -- people who don't imagine settling here permanently. &amp;nbsp;Moreover, the expats here in Shanghai tend not to learn the language at all. &amp;nbsp;It's easy to get by without really knowing any Chinese; just hang out in specific restaurants and bars, show addresses to cab drivers on your phone in Chinese, order things online that cater to the foreign population. &amp;nbsp;Admittedly, I think it's easier to get by without knowing Chinese if you don't look Chinese (i.e you're not me) because the assumption is that you don't speak the language, but that's its own story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite often, expats here are sent by the companies for which they already work, their spouses and children in tow, and get a generous compensation package. &amp;nbsp;They send their kids to international schools and can hire an &lt;i&gt;ayi&lt;/i&gt;, a Chinese woman hired to help with various chores (though they are not necessarily like live-in maids like in Hong Kong or Singapore). &amp;nbsp;Their social circle is composed of other foreigners in a similar situation. &amp;nbsp;Generally, everyone knows that they're in Shanghai for a limited amount of time, though of course, this can change if a contract is extended. &amp;nbsp;Like I said, the expat community is in a constant state of flux.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immigrant experience and the word "immigrant," I think, can be a politically charged term, especially in the United States. &amp;nbsp;The media highlights how communities think immigrants are taking jobs, how they don't learn English (though the U.S. doesn't have an official language), how they don't integrate into the community, how there's waves of them coming. &amp;nbsp;In the United States, it sometimes can feel like the word "immigrant" is not perceived in the most positive terms, even if the country was actually a country founded by immigrants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-l7p4Lp_pIYs/VTOyL5hyhXI/AAAAAAAABlw/djiFgZ2b024/s1600/zhangjiajie2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;And here's another photo from Zhangjiajie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience in Germany has made me come to the realization that I myself am an immigrant. &amp;nbsp;I'm saying this out loud, and it's a bit weird to write it, but it's the truth -- I don't know when I'm moving back to the United States. &amp;nbsp;For now, I'm an expat in Shanghai because at this point, my time here is limited, I'm not integrated into the local community (though I am learning the language), and I can't see myself settling here permanently. &amp;nbsp;In Germany, I'm an immigrant and not an expat. &amp;nbsp;I've integrated myself into the local community and it's my second home. &amp;nbsp;The United States is my &lt;i&gt;Heimat&lt;/i&gt; (homeland), but Germany is &lt;i&gt;zu Hause&lt;/i&gt; (home).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So returning to the question, am I an expat squared? &amp;nbsp;No, I'm not, and it is precisely the distinction between expats and immigrants that makes all the difference. &amp;nbsp;I'm not going to change the name of this blog again, but I've given a lot of thought to "expat" and "immigrant" and my own experiences. &amp;nbsp;In Germany, I don't really know what the expat scene is like. &amp;nbsp;I did my master's at the local university, and it helps that Christian is from Düsseldorf so I've gotten to know local Düsseldorfer. &amp;nbsp;Here in Shanghai, I'm naturally a part of the expat community because of my limited language skills. &amp;nbsp;Even if I wanted to become more integrated, it's going to take more time than it did in Germany and based on the fact that my time here is limited (for now), it's unlikely that becoming integrated is possible. &amp;nbsp;And even if it were, the question is if I would want to stay here on a more permanent basis, for which the answer currently is "no." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual truth is that this blog should probably be called Expat Turned Immigrant Turned Expat. &amp;nbsp;Originally, I was an expat in Germany, but turned out to be an immigrant and now I'm an expat again. &amp;nbsp;But that's an overly complex name, and nobody would be able to remember it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/1172503033008102080/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=1172503033008102080&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1172503033008102080'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1172503033008102080'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2015/04/differences-between-expats-immigrants.html' title='Differences Between Expats &amp;

 Commonality: &lt;/i&gt;You'll probably be given a grumbling look regardless of what paperwork you do or don't have. &amp;nbsp;I actually didn't have all the paperwork when I re-registered myself here in China after changing my visa type, even though I looked at the list my visa agent had given me about 20 times. &amp;nbsp;I basically just waved all my paperwork at the guy's face and told him in my basic Chinese, "I don't know what you mean!" &amp;nbsp;He rolled his eyes and registered me anyway. &amp;nbsp;Lesson learned: Just be sassy right back at them, even if your language skills are basic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;  Getting a work permit as a foreigner &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;  German government: &lt;/i&gt;You can't work in Germany as a non-EU citizen unless you have a special skill that nobody else can offer and you're getting paid at least this very specific amount of euros. &amp;nbsp; We do make the exception that if you're a "highly qualified professional," which we deem are scientists and engineers because you know, this is Germany, or if you've gotten a degree at one of our free universities, you can find a job here of your choosing. &amp;nbsp;These are the rules and you must follow them, but we've outlined them clearly so you can figure it out yourself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;  Chinese government: &lt;/i&gt;You can't work in China as a foreigner unless you have a special skill, though it's kind of a grey area. &amp;nbsp;We have multiple business visa types and some companies will offer you one visa and not the other, but you should make sure you have the right one. &amp;nbsp;How do you know which one is the right one? &amp;nbsp;Google that. &amp;nbsp;Oh wait, haha, Google's blocked. &amp;nbsp;Baidu it even though the search results are rubbish if it's not in Chinese. &amp;nbsp;And because that won't work, you'll probably hire a visa agent anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;  Commonality: &lt;/i&gt;Basically you need to offer some skill that the locals can't provide, which is why so many people wind up teaching their native language. &amp;nbsp;This isn't really that surprising. &lt;br /&gt;The difference though is that Germany has very clear-cut rules that are outlined on an official website somewhere in both German and English. &amp;nbsp;China's rules are very grey and not really outlined well at all. &amp;nbsp;I've also found many of their websites just don't work properly or aren't updated regularly. &amp;nbsp;Looking it up on the internet, you'll find so many different answers that it seems like finding the right one is as easy as spotting the Loch Ness Monster. &amp;nbsp;What people say in forums versus what you hear people talk about versus what you actually experience can be very different. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;  Changing your visa from one to another when living in the country already &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;  German government: &lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;As an American citizen, you can just change it here in Germany. &amp;nbsp;But we'll need to see your marriage license, your passport, a copy of your partner's German passport, a copy of your apartment lease, proof of your insurance, a biometric photo, and this very specific application form which is available in German, English, French, Italian, Greek, Turkish, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian. &amp;nbsp;It'll take up to six weeks to process and will cost you 110€. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;  Chinese government &lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Brace yourself because this is going to take at least two months to complete if you have all the correct paperwork, but you're also going to have to go back to your home country or try your luck in Hong Kong. &amp;nbsp;If you go to Hong Kong, it's not guaranteed you'll actually get the visa you need because they could turn you down. &amp;nbsp;But first, you need to apply for an alien employment license and invitation letter of Duly Authorized Unit. &amp;nbsp;We won't explain to you what exactly that is. &amp;nbsp;Then you'll have to leave the country and get a visa from your local Chinese consulate or go to Hong Kong. &amp;nbsp;Once you come back into the country, then you have to apply for your residence permit. &amp;nbsp;We'll need at least 12 documents from you: your passport, your resume, copy of the company business license where you want to work, a copy of the company's organization code license, a copy of the company approval certificate, copies of your university degrees, reference letters from foreign companies that prove you have at least two years' experience in the field where you're working, your employment contract, your temporary residence permit, a health test that you have completed here in China, seven passport photos, your alien employment license, and an invitation letter of Duly Authorized Unit. &amp;nbsp;You can't possibly do any of this by yourself because you're a foreigner and we won't provide any forms in anything but Chinese. &amp;nbsp;So just go find yourself a nice visa agent who will guide you through the process.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;  Commonality: &lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Not much. &amp;nbsp;I did indeed have to leave China and chose to go back to Germany to apply for my new visa. &amp;nbsp;I was only allowed to do this and didn't have to fly back to the U.S. because I still have permanent residency in Germany.  &lt;br /&gt;When I first arrived in China, I was on an S1 visa that allowed me to be in the country as the spouse of a foreigner working here, but I wasn't allowed to work. &amp;nbsp;After finding a job, I had to change it to a Z visa. &amp;nbsp;Luckily the company I'm working for has a visa agent (whose name is Magic, I kid you not) who helped me through the entire process. &amp;nbsp;I had to first apply for some documents here in Shanghai that would then give me some new documents that I would submit to the Chinese consulate in Germany. &amp;nbsp;Then the consulate in Germany would give me a new visa, with which I would use to come back to China and then apply for the residence permit. &amp;nbsp;Does that sound confusing? &amp;nbsp;It is. &lt;br /&gt;I was so happy that I didn't have to go through the medical test again and was pleasantly surprised that I could use the one I originally went through when I first got to Shanghai. &amp;nbsp;The medical test makes you feel like you're on an assembly line just going through all the different rooms and it's really far from where I live. &amp;nbsp;And it was just one less thing to worry about, though admittedly I was nervous that Magic would come back and tell me that he made a mistake and that I would have to go through the medical exam again. &lt;br /&gt;Back in Germany, I always complained about my visa costing 110€ or so. &amp;nbsp;I shouldn't have because the visa and paperwork for it in China alone probably cost a little over 500€. &amp;nbsp;That doesn't include the cost of my flight back to Germany; even if I had gone to Hong Kong to do a visa run, the cost of the flight and hotel together all adds up quite a bit. &amp;nbsp;Add on the stress of hoping that the Frankfurt consulate would give me my passport back on time so I didn't have to change my flight back to Shanghai...it made for a very annoying experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--hepbFpsQgE/VRai8YIj_RI/AAAAAAAABk4/okDyvPWT5yc/s1600/pudong_skyline.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

   Paperwork isn't fun, so here's a non-filtered photo of where I live.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;  Opening a bank account &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;  German bank:  &lt;/i&gt;You have to show us your passport, your residence permit, your registration form and depending on the bank, maybe even your job contract. &amp;nbsp;There will be some forms to fill out, but it shouldn't take all that long and we can explain them to you since they're in German. &amp;nbsp;We'll sign you up for online banking if you want, but it's really easy to do transfers at the banking terminal without a real live teller anyway. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;  Chinese bank: &lt;/i&gt;You have to show us your passport, your residence permit, your temporary residence permit, and your job contract. &amp;nbsp;You'll have to fill out these forms, none of which you can actually read nor will we explain them to you, but it's fine because nobody reads them. &amp;nbsp;We won't tell you about online banking at all since you probably won't use it anyway; the website only works using Windows and Internet Explorer. &amp;nbsp;And transfers? &amp;nbsp;Good luck on figuring that out, but everyone just asks for cash anyway. &amp;nbsp;Oh, and sorry, we're having problems verifying your American social security number with your passport number. &amp;nbsp;You'll have to come back some other day because we can't open your bank account right now. &amp;nbsp;Lastly -- why can't you speak Chinese? &amp;nbsp;You look Chinese. &amp;nbsp;Aren't you Chinese? &amp;nbsp;What's wrong with you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;  Commonality: &lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;I find it weird that you have to ask for online banking in either country and that it's not a given. &amp;nbsp;It's even worse that online banking here only works on Windows and IE, but apparently it's a very common issue here in Asia.  &lt;br /&gt;I did actually have problems opening a bank account here because there were issues verifying my social security number and my American passport number. &amp;nbsp;I don't really know why, and I did have to go back and spend another hour of my life trying to open the account. &amp;nbsp;And yes, they actually asked Ningxin, who was helping me open the bank account, not once, not twice, but  &lt;i&gt;  &lt;u&gt;    three times&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; what was wrong with me and why I couldn't speak Chinese. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;  Verdict &lt;/h4&gt;Chinese bureaucracy is bureaucracy at its best, and by "best," I mean the worst. &amp;nbsp;You need paperwork to get more paperwork to submit and get more stamps and pay this fee and it's just a never ending whirlwind of documents. &amp;nbsp;Everything also seems a bit grey; the websites never detail anything and you just sort of do what you're told, no questions asked. &amp;nbsp;Part of it is not being able to speak the language and having to blindly trust the visa agent. &amp;nbsp;I've been fortunate enough that my job has covered the expenses for me and they were already in touch with Magic, but I can't imagine having to do this all on your own. &amp;nbsp;In Germany, it's completely possible to get your residence permit and visa on your own, even if you don't know the language. &amp;nbsp;It's a little more accommodating there, but it's probably because of the EU and Europe is such a small place. &amp;nbsp;When my friends who used to live in China tell me it became tiring to have to renew their visas every year, I believe it. &lt;br /&gt;If and when I leave China, all I know is that there is also paperwork involved to make it official. &amp;nbsp;In Germany, I don't know how it works, so maybe someone can enlighten me. &amp;nbsp;But friends living in Germany who are not German: really, the bureaucracy in Germany isn't that bad.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/1988193064307999591/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=1988193064307999591&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1988193064307999591'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1988193064307999591'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2015/03/chinese-vs-german-bureaucracy-comparison.html' title='Chinese vs German Bureaucracy: A Comparison'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0iY4f1EHH5I/VRZJcwPqmBI/AAAAAAAABks/BGBerc0hrMo/s72-c/bureaucratic_docs.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-7195204102548499432</id><published>2015-02-18T11:07:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2015-02-19T11:35:15.769+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='photos'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shanghai'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='metro'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='public transporation'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shitiseeontheshanghaisubway'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='china'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='subway'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='underground'/><title type='text'>Pictures are Worth 1,000 Words</title><content type='html'>I know I haven't written recently much, but there are so many topics I still want to cover that I haven't gotten around to: the pains of changing my visa, the difference between being an "expat" and an "immigrant," the joys of being an American-born Chinese person and struggling with the language, starting work in a Chinese office...but I admittedly haven't gotten around to it. &amp;nbsp;I'll get to those in the future, I promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I've actually been doing a lot of recently is taking photos in the subway. &amp;nbsp;I have a 45-minute commute one way, so I have a long enough ride that I can people-watch. &amp;nbsp;And people-watching in the Shanghai subway is...interesting. &amp;nbsp;For one, everyone is on their smartphone watching videos and they ignore people they're with or forget to actually get off at the correct stop. &amp;nbsp;I even learned the term for these people in Mandarin -- 低头族 (ditou zu), smartphone addicts, or I think the literal rough translation would be "those who keep their heads bowed." &amp;nbsp;(I learned this from listening to some podcast)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's been some really funny/odd/disgusting things I've seen in the subway, and I've sent them to some people swearing I need to start a blog or hashtag, #shitiseeontheshanghaisubway. &amp;nbsp;So here are things that I've seen and observed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;There's the odd exception:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1AumfdM-LqY/VOROxHwG2GI/AAAAAAAABiM/ZxyCfi2bVzE/s1600/AdobePhotoshopExpress_a890171a3b644c3681283839b27b7c0d.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1AumfdM-LqY/VOROxHwG2GI/AAAAAAAABiM/ZxyCfi2bVzE/s1600/AdobePhotoshopExpress_a890171a3b644c3681283839b27b7c0d.jpg" width="596" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this photo today in the Lujiazui subway station at rush hour. &amp;nbsp;For those of you who are unfamiliar with Shanghai, Lujiazui is the financial district. &amp;nbsp;Normally at rush hour, this station is overflowing with people shoving and elbowing their way onto the escalator, and it's total chaos. &amp;nbsp;Today, it was like an apocalyptic movie with it being the first day of the Chinese New Year holidays. &amp;nbsp;There was hardly anyone in the station. &amp;nbsp;I basically just went around taking pictures of the empty city, but this is the empty station, which is very rare indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;There's the matching ridiculousness that goes on:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;There's the smartphone addicts who make great parents:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;On the left, take a look at the little girl in the pink jacket sitting down. &amp;nbsp;Who's her mom, you wonder? &amp;nbsp;Or is the little girl by herself? &amp;nbsp;It took me awhile to realize it, but the woman standing in the red coat &lt;i&gt;with her back to the little girl&lt;/i&gt; is actually her mom. &amp;nbsp;I only figured it out because she put her phone down once and said something to her daughter. &amp;nbsp;On the right, you can see the little girl is amusing herself with a birthday hat or something while her mom is glued to her phone &lt;i&gt;with her headphones on&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I also thought the little girl might be by herself, but her mom said something to her without taking the headphones out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might argue with me that I just happened to take a photo when these moms were looking at their phones. &amp;nbsp;Sadly, that wasn't the case. &amp;nbsp;I observed these mothers ignoring their daughters for the whole ride. &amp;nbsp;And unfortunately, this happens so frequently that I'd actually say it's the norm. &amp;nbsp;At New Year's, there was a table of adults behind us, and one of the guys at the table was playing on his iPad &lt;i&gt;the whole time&lt;/i&gt; and ignored his friends or family, whichever they were. &amp;nbsp;Couples go on dates and ignore each other, which makes me wonder if they're writing to each other on their phones. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first arrived here in Shanghai, I was impressed with how everyone is so connected and everyone seems to have the latest iPhone or Xiaomi or Samsung smartphone. &amp;nbsp;But I think the connectivity affects how people interact with each other, where people just don't want to converse and they'd rather watch their favorite show instead. &amp;nbsp;And as I mentioned already, this is normal here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;There's the purely disgusting people:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hYGK9TTFB3U/VORNEgf0OHI/AAAAAAAABgw/XhUg2Un6ap0/s1600/WP_20150205_002.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hYGK9TTFB3U/VORNEgf0OHI/AAAAAAAABgw/XhUg2Un6ap0/s1600/WP_20150205_002.jpg" height="200" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;OK, I'm not looking for disgusting people on the subway. &amp;nbsp;I'm really not. &amp;nbsp;But sometimes it's hard not to see them, and unfortunately, I think what people put up with here, what westerners consider disgusting, might be more acceptable. &amp;nbsp;Let's take the guy on the left. &amp;nbsp;He was picking his nose the entire 30 minutes he was sitting next to me on the train. &amp;nbsp;I tried really hard to ignore him, but it was like he was digging for oil there. &amp;nbsp;I also scooted away once there was space, but it seems that picking your nose in public is apparently acceptable because I see it all. the. time. &amp;nbsp;Not only that, I've noticed that men here will often have one fingernail much longer than the others. &amp;nbsp;And by "much longer," I'm meaning creepy long, something that I don't even have because I can't type with long nails. &amp;nbsp;Anyway, the purpose of having the one long fingernail? &amp;nbsp;So you can find gold up your nose! &amp;nbsp;I wish I could tell you I was making this up, but I'm really not that creative. &amp;nbsp;I asked Ningxin when I first came to China if there was a beauty aesthetic with the nail, and she was like, "Nope, it's for picking your nose."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of fingernails, we have the guy in the photo on the right who just decided to cut them on the train. &amp;nbsp;Maybe this is just me, but I find it particularly repulsive to have fingernails flying left and right, not to mention the noise it makes rubs me the wrong way. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, this also seems to be a thing that Chinese people find OK to do in public. &amp;nbsp;I know people in the office cut their nails and I just wonder why they can't take the five minutes to do it at home. &amp;nbsp;I think cutting your nails in public is something I've heard of people observing on the subway in New York City, but I am personally generally not OK with it. &amp;nbsp;This is the face I make when I see these things on the subway:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;The first photo I took because this baby was super cute in (presumably) her pink onesie that looked warm as hell. &amp;nbsp;Plus the onesie had little feet and the hood had bunny ears. &amp;nbsp;The dad was cuddling with the baby the whole time, while the mom was (unsurprisingly) looking at her phone. &amp;nbsp;I should also point out the weird furry boots the mom is wearing. &amp;nbsp;That's also a common sight here in China, but I'm not categorizing it with "absolute cuteness." &amp;nbsp;The second photo was of a little girl with her mom. &amp;nbsp;The little girl had this penguin hat which had these long flaps that came down with pockets at the end to keep your hands warm. &amp;nbsp;Cute and ingenious! &amp;nbsp;And the last photo was because of the little boy's backpack, which is a fish. &amp;nbsp;How adorable is that? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Stuff for kids here is incredibly cute, I'll admit that. &amp;nbsp;But it weirds me out when this then extends to things for adults that are supposed to be "cute," but by western standards just come off as, well, childish. &amp;nbsp;Seeing grown women with a large collection of stuffed animals in the back of their cars (like a life-sized Stitch doll, as in, Lilo &amp;amp; Stitch, which yes, I have experienced here) or grown women with a Dora the Explorer luggage decorated with Hello Kitty stickers while also carrying a Michael Kors bag (real or not) is just sort of this weird dichotomy where I can't take these people seriously. &amp;nbsp;I get it, things for kids are cute, but please stop buying these cute things for yourself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;There's a lot of other stuff I've seen on the subway which I haven't gotten pictures of -- men holding their girlfriends' or wives' purses, a Chinese guy with very impressive fro-y dreadlocks, the amount of food people eat, the fantastic (by which I mean really funny/hilarious/terrible) knock-off products that people have...the list goes on. &amp;nbsp;I might add more stuff as the year goes on because I'm sure that I'll be seeing some really amazing things once summer comes. &amp;nbsp;Or I'll just be terribly grumpy because it'll be really hot and the train will be really full, as always. &amp;nbsp;We'll see what happens.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

even &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2014/12/30/china-unblocks-gmail/"&gt;Gmail has been blocked&lt;/a&gt; via protocol (supposedly it's working again, but I haven't gotten any emails from my Gmail account on my phone for days). &amp;nbsp;Some may argue that there aren't any good WP apps available out there and everything is being developed for iOS and Android. &amp;nbsp;This may be true, but by doing some research and following sites like &lt;a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/"&gt;Windows Central&lt;/a&gt;, I've found some great apps that have helped me greatly here in China. &amp;nbsp;Here are five apps that have made adjusting to life here much easier. &amp;nbsp;(Note that I'm not including photo apps here because although they're great to have, these apps are really about adjusting to life here in China.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3ogPh04aDEM/VKkg7vrnH_I/AAAAAAAABeM/oCvI4N0Rsc8/s1600/maps.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3ogPh04aDEM/VKkg7vrnH_I/AAAAAAAABeM/oCvI4N0Rsc8/s1600/maps.png" height="171" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. &amp;nbsp;HERE Maps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been using HERE Maps pretty much since I got the phone and knew it was pretty handy when abroad since I can use maps offline if I download them beforehand. &amp;nbsp;While in Budapest, London, and India, this was extremely practical when trying to get around on foot and public transportation. &amp;nbsp;Moreover, it has the metro and bus stations and stops directly on the map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Shanghai, this has been helpful because I don't need to use what little data I have on a prepaid plan to find my way around. &amp;nbsp;I've started using location services all the time because I never know where I am. &amp;nbsp;HERE Maps makes it easy to save places and look them up. &amp;nbsp;I appreciate the fact that I can search in pinyin and Chinese characters as well as English versus Chinese address format without having to change any language preferences. &amp;nbsp;For example, I can search by entering "Zhongshan Road, Shanghai" or I can input, "上海市中山路". &amp;nbsp;I can even search by putting in "Zhongshan Lu, Shanghai" and mix the English pinyin and format and still find what I'm looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also quite handy is having the exits for each metro stop easily visible on the entire map. &amp;nbsp;Here in Shanghai, metro stations can have 20-odd exits and be really enormous, like the People's Square stop. &amp;nbsp;Normally I look up where I'm going and check out the closest exit which makes getting around much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UpCZnRFszZs/VKkTwJ8WcpI/AAAAAAAABcM/Ui3EhnAm6Qc/s1600/heremaps1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UpCZnRFszZs/VKkTwJ8WcpI/AAAAAAAABcM/Ui3EhnAm6Qc/s320/heremaps1.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jiZVZ8Vfxfg/VKkTxjJmqLI/AAAAAAAABcU/hsBxaBqi7CQ/s1600/heremaps2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jiZVZ8Vfxfg/VKkTxjJmqLI/AAAAAAAABcU/hsBxaBqi7CQ/s320/heremaps2.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. &amp;nbsp;YiXue Chinese Dictionary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know how I found this app, but it's helped me learn written Chinese really easily. &amp;nbsp;It's a straightforward app that allows me to look up words in English, pinyin, and Chinese characters (both traditional and simplified!). &amp;nbsp;This is good because sometimes I know the pinyin and want to know what the character looks like, sometimes I know what the character is but don't know the English meaning or pinyin, or I just know the English and need to know the Chinese, both pinyin and character. &amp;nbsp;Of course, this means I've installed different Chinese input keyboards on my phone too -- the ability to enter pinyin like a regular keyboard and then one that recognizes handwriting. &amp;nbsp;And my phone doesn't care about stroke order like my Chinese teacher would; as long as I get it close enough, it'll give me a list of suggestions that I can choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's also great about YiXue is that I have the ability to create lists of words. &amp;nbsp;Currently, I've created two lists -- Common Vocabulary, which are words I see all the time when I'm out and about, and Tuttle Vocabulary, which are words I'm learning to write based on &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tuttle-Learning-Chinese-Characters-Revolutionary/dp/080483816X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1420361744&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=tuttle+learning+chinese+characters"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The app also has the default list of HSK Level 1 vocabulary, so all the words for the first level official Chinese language test are in one place. &amp;nbsp;Moreover, the lists can be used in study mode, which is like having flashcards, and then different games to test your knowledge. &amp;nbsp;It can test you on Chinese character + pinyin, pinyin + English meaning, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also what's fantastic for learning the language is that YiXue shows you sentences with the word you've looked up so you can see some context. &amp;nbsp;Anyone who's learned a language knows that context is everything, so being able to see the word in action has given me a better understanding of how to use specific keywords. &amp;nbsp;YiXue even shows you the sentences in simplified and traditional, which again, is super helpful depending on where you are or in my case, when I might know the word in traditional writing but not simplified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would love to have on this app is that the words that I keep forgetting would pop up more frequently or that I could create a separate list from the ones that haven't stuck in my memory. &amp;nbsp;I talked to Christian and I actually couldn't find a similar app for his iPhone. &amp;nbsp;YiXue is definitely the best app helping out with the language barrier and I would recommend it to anyone even just traveling in China. &amp;nbsp;The app is free, but if you pay the $2 to unlock it, you're not limited to only three searches per session, no ads, and a few other things. &amp;nbsp;To be honest, the two bucks is probably the best money I've spent on any app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gKMbyxjyToc/VKkVLI_UxlI/AAAAAAAABcg/_o02HadHcrI/s1600/yixue1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gKMbyxjyToc/VKkVLI_UxlI/AAAAAAAABcg/_o02HadHcrI/s320/yixue1.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-af6m7uevKRg/VKkVMg-SVeI/AAAAAAAABco/AqJEALvta7Y/s1600/yixue2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-af6m7uevKRg/VKkVMg-SVeI/AAAAAAAABco/AqJEALvta7Y/s320/yixue2.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. &amp;nbsp;BJ Air&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being an expat in China, you learn to accept the idea that leaving the apartment means dealing with the pollution. &amp;nbsp;I don't think Shanghai's pollution is nearly as bad as Beijing's, like how this &lt;a href="http://www.handelsblatt.com/technologie/energie-umwelt/umwelt-news/pekings-dicke-luft-leben-in-der-smoghauptstadt/11178494.html"&gt;Handelsblatt article&lt;/a&gt; talks about a flight being grounded and not being able to return to the terminal because the smog was so thick. &amp;nbsp;Even so, I've found myself constantly checking the Air Quality Index on my phone so I know when I shouldn't go outside for longer periods of time or if I need to wear a face mask (yes, I've adopted wearing a face mask because the pollution is horrendous compared to Germany or the US).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple apps out there available, so I'm not necessarily praising BJ Air in particular, but just mentioning how convenient it is to have this information available on my phone. &amp;nbsp;What I like in particular about BJ Air and the Windows Phone is that I don't have to open the app to see the information -- the Live Tile shows me the information directly and is as easy as checking the time. &amp;nbsp;BJ Air is a simple, elegant app that gives me what I need at a glance. &amp;nbsp;It only has the information for Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, so for people in other cities, this app isn't really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YesL7-czbZo/VKkWDfhE06I/AAAAAAAABc4/BbpSzaHXE8Y/s1600/bjair1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YesL7-czbZo/VKkWDfhE06I/AAAAAAAABc4/BbpSzaHXE8Y/s320/bjair1.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A4TAUG31Xmg/VKkWDn5ZE5I/AAAAAAAABc8/CNBfG7tu7_s/s1600/bjair2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A4TAUG31Xmg/VKkWDn5ZE5I/AAAAAAAABc8/CNBfG7tu7_s/s320/bjair2.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. &amp;nbsp;Bing Translator&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've actually started using Bing a lot more here in China just because Google is blocked. &amp;nbsp;So when I'm on-the-go, my go-to search engine is Bing since I don't feel like having to turn on my VPN over cellular data (I get the feeling that it's just too slow and that drives me nuts). &amp;nbsp;The Bing Translator app is surprisingly pretty good and even allows me to translate things offline since I downloaded the Chinese-English language pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually use the Bing Translator most often to translate text messages that I get from China Mobile telling me how much money I owe them or whatever other random messages I get. &amp;nbsp;It's pretty easy to copy + paste text into it, though the translation is frequently imperfect and requires some sort of deciphering (to be fair, Google Translate has its issues as well). &amp;nbsp;I also can get pronunciation when I input the Chinese, which has also been good for learning the language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's been a slight disappointment is the camera translator. &amp;nbsp;Unless the Chinese is on a huge sign, for example, holding up my phone and trying to translate small text on packaging in the supermarket has been rather unsuccessful. &amp;nbsp;Considering my camera has 41 megapixels, I would think this wouldn't be an issue, but it seems that the translator app and my camera don't really work very well together. &amp;nbsp;Most of the time, the issue is that the camera can't focus and find the text, so it's actually easier for me to just input the text by entering it via the handwriting keyboard. &amp;nbsp;Even so, the app still has its uses when I'm translating a sentence or more; if I need just one or two words, I'll use YiXue. &amp;nbsp;I haven't tried out the voice translator yet, but I just feel dumb talking to my phone to translate something anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z9PP05lLDmo/VKkWhhENTeI/AAAAAAAABdM/SR1gJ_17mCA/s1600/bingtranslate2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z9PP05lLDmo/VKkWhhENTeI/AAAAAAAABdM/SR1gJ_17mCA/s320/bingtranslate2.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bJ2De4m_ft4/VKkWhJJBssI/AAAAAAAABdI/cAjBg9iPKzM/s1600/bingtranslate1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bJ2De4m_ft4/VKkWhJJBssI/AAAAAAAABdI/cAjBg9iPKzM/s320/bingtranslate1.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. &amp;nbsp;WeChat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've saved WeChat for last because this is an app that's rather specific to the Chinese market. &amp;nbsp;Here in China, it's known as Weixin 微信, and is a messaging app kind of like WhatsApp. &amp;nbsp;Except that I've described it to my friends as a WhatsApp-meets-Facebook app because it's got a lot more features on it, including video calls. &amp;nbsp;So yes, WeChat has the functionality that you can send your friends messages like any other messaging app on there. &amp;nbsp;One thing I particularly love in WeChat is the stickers, which are basically animated gifs. &amp;nbsp;There's a lot of super cute ones that I use a lot, but it also has the ability to make your own stickers and I've had way too much fun looking for Liz Lemon gifs to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1g9Yd237avA/VKkYqIZfn-I/AAAAAAAABd8/pAvf48slKaA/s1600/selfhighfive.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1g9Yd237avA/VKkYqIZfn-I/AAAAAAAABd8/pAvf48slKaA/s1600/selfhighfive.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WeChat also makes it easy to connect to people, whether sharing a name card within a chat, using QR codes that you can scan to add a contact, or using a radar-type thing to add nearby people. &amp;nbsp;It's also practical for group chats; I'm in a few different groups with 20+ more people that I don't even know and don't need to add them as contacts. &amp;nbsp;These groups are for Middlebury alum, a meet-up group, a NESCAC alum group, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But WeChat is also like Facebook because you can post Moments, which is its equivalent of the Timeline/Newsfeed. &amp;nbsp;You can comment and like things, but my favorite part of it is that only contacts that you and the other person have in common will see whatever activity you put on there. &amp;nbsp;For example, if Christian posted a photo from our vacation and I wrote a comment on it, only our mutual contacts could see my comment. &amp;nbsp;So his coworker that I don't have on WeChat won't see what I wrote, and if Christian and I have a conversation in comments, his coworker won't be bombarded with notifications if they also write something. &amp;nbsp;Essentially, the only person who knows how much activity a specific post got is the person who actually created the post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, WeChat is good for following official accounts. &amp;nbsp;For example, I follow the Shanghai Metro, one of the &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2014/12/discovering-shanghai-via-its-vinyl.html"&gt;record stores&lt;/a&gt; I found here, Buzzfeed, and a few others so that I get updates directly in WeChat. &amp;nbsp;The information I get from them is more personalized; I specifically only wanted cute things from Buzzfeed (I admit it, I'm a sucker for their animal posts), so I actually only get content from them that they've labeled "cute." &amp;nbsp;I recently read &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/02/chat-apps-increasingly-important-for-brands/"&gt;this article on TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; about how chat apps are the new form of social media, and frankly, this rings really true when you see WeChat in action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, nobody exchanges phone numbers here anymore. &amp;nbsp;The first question when swapping contact information is, "What's your WeChat?" &amp;nbsp;Even all the expats here use it. &amp;nbsp;I only wish that more people outside China would use it because it's got a lot more features than WhatsApp and isn't as annoying as Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HLSk4pZBLfU/VKkXIUQx_qI/AAAAAAAABdY/ZRcmDEl8mno/s1600/wechat1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HLSk4pZBLfU/VKkXIUQx_qI/AAAAAAAABdY/ZRcmDEl8mno/s320/wechat1.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1djJRjJJTa4/VKkXJd4n6nI/AAAAAAAABdg/UPWhyWoRdhA/s1600/wechat2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1djJRjJJTa4/VKkXJd4n6nI/AAAAAAAABdg/UPWhyWoRdhA/s320/wechat2.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In addition to these five apps, there are others that I'm still figuring out how to use, like Didi Dache (the Chinese version of Uber) and Dianping (the Chinese version of Yelp). &amp;nbsp;These are a little more complicated since they don't have English-language versions, but with Dianping, I've at least figured out how to find restaurants and browse through content. &amp;nbsp;There's also one or two other apps I've been using, but these five were definitely the ones that I've been using on a daily basis and making adjusting to life in China way easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you're interested in general UI trends in apps here in China, take a look at this &lt;a href="http://dangrover.com/blog/2014/12/01/chinese-mobile-app-ui-trends.html"&gt;well-written article&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for some great insight.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/56941269916814557/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=56941269916814557&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/56941269916814557'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/56941269916814557'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2015/01/5-apps-making-my-life-easier-in-china.html' title='5 Apps Making My Life Easier in China'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3ogPh04aDEM/VKkg7vrnH_I/AAAAAAAABeM/oCvI4N0Rsc8/s72-c/maps.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-4587326238707001711</id><published>2014-12-12T17:40:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-12-12T17:40:25.844+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shanghai'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='records'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='rock music'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='vinyl'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='vinyl shopping'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='china'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='record shopping'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='rock'/><title type='text'>Discovering Shanghai via Its Vinyl Stores</title><content type='html'>Not only have I been &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2014/12/figuring-out-chinese-e-commerce-websites.html"&gt;figuring out how to buy vinyl&lt;/a&gt; on Taobao.com, I also decided that in a city as big as Shanghai, there had to be some interesting record shops I could discover. &amp;nbsp;Again, the mentality is that maybe I can find interesting releases here easier than I could in Europe or North America. &amp;nbsp;But actually going out and finding local record shops was also a good way to go exploring the city. &amp;nbsp;I'm a huge proponent of public transportation, so this was also a great excuse to just ride around the metro. &amp;nbsp;Shanghai is full of so many enormous malls and chain stores that seeking out some hole-in-the-wall, locally owned stores just really appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Admittedly, I first started searching online, entering "Shanghai record shop" and "Shanghai vinyl store" into Google. &amp;nbsp;I got a few articles, but most of them were from about two years ago or so. &amp;nbsp;Realizing how quickly the city is changing, I didn't expect all of them to still be around since it seems like two years here is an eternity. &amp;nbsp;Taking &lt;a href="http://www.echinacities.com/Shanghai/city-guide/The-Shanghai-Music-Guide-Record-Stores-Equipment-Recording-Studios-Venues"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; as my main point of reference along with &lt;a href="http://matthayward.com/2013/01/01/buying-vinyl-records-in-shanghai.htm"&gt;this blog entry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/groups/topic/359901"&gt;this discussion on discogs.com&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;I mapped out six record shops I wanted to visit, all of which were on the Puxi side of the city. &amp;nbsp;(As an aside, one of the reasons why I'm writing this is to have updated information about these places out there.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Based purely on location, I decided to first visit the so-called "lamp fixtures market store" because the nearest metro station is also on the 7 line, which is the closest line to where I live. &amp;nbsp;I found the market and the place where the shop supposedly was, but it looked closed. &amp;nbsp;Disappointed, I left and went to check out &lt;a href="http://uptownchina.com/"&gt;Uptown Records&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Similarly, I found the building where it was, but it too was not open. &amp;nbsp;I wasn't sure if it was right or not because the entrance is beneath a residence building and it looks like you'll get murdered (see third image below for reference). At that point, I wasn't about to trek out to the other stores only to end up feeling like I wasted a whole day in case they weren't open. &amp;nbsp;This was last Tuesday afternoon, and Uptown Records supposedly opened at 2. &amp;nbsp;I was there at around 2:30 in the afternoon, so I figured it must've just been a fluke. &amp;nbsp;Dejected, I went home and left the other shops for another day.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Determined to figure out if these two stores actually were still open, I searched the internet for contact information and wrote them in English and Google-translated Chinese. &amp;nbsp;The lamp fixtures market one wrote back saying he was still open. &amp;nbsp;I knew Uptown was still open because when I was there and trying to figure out if I was the right place, I asked an old lady outside the building if she knew the store. &amp;nbsp;All I could understand was that the day I visited, either the store wasn't open or was opening later.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having evidence that the lamp fixtures market store is actually still in business, I went again midday on a Wednesday (the day before yesterday). &amp;nbsp;And bingo, the place is indeed still in operation and actually called Vinyl Villa. &amp;nbsp;(Note to anyone who is actually looking to find these place, I've detailed how to find the shops that are still open at the bottom of this article.) &amp;nbsp;It's definitely not a touristy part of town and it's not a place that you would normally stumble across walking around since it's on the second floor of an actual lamp fixture market. &amp;nbsp;If you look at the image below, that's what the complex looks like where Vinyl Villa is housed. &amp;nbsp;The store isn't huge, but there is a good selection of vinyl to look through -- classic rock, jazz, funk/soul, hip-hop, and a small selection of punk. &amp;nbsp;It looked like everything is secondhand and a mixed bag of Japanese, British, and American releases. &amp;nbsp;I mostly took a look through the rock section and found that there was a lot of Elton John, REO Speedwagon, Foreigner, and Journey. &amp;nbsp;Even so, I was surprised to find copies of &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Happy+Meals,+Volume+1:+A+Smorgasbord+of+My+Favorite+Songs"&gt;Happy Meals Vol. 1&lt;/a&gt; (a compilation with Nerf Herder on it which made me nostalgic for high school), Voodoo Glow Skulls' &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/6ANmj9hLIEMzNeJGMXdLsW"&gt;The Band Geek Mafia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, and some &lt;a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/7ddEExcNWHxN2fwS1kTwkk"&gt;Potshot&lt;/a&gt; records.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align:

border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-d5-mhb191fs/VIsQojMg0MI/AAAAAAAABZw/l12NTNpi_LQ/s1600/vinyl_villa.png" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The light fixtures market where Vinyl Villa is&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;It took me awhile to file through all of the rock bins. &amp;nbsp;While I did, the music that the owner, Frank, played was seriously the most varied playlist. &amp;nbsp;What I remember: something from Rammstein, Louis Armstrong's cover of "La Vie En Rose," "Carry on My Wayward Son" from Kansas, and "Ramblin' Man" from the Allman Brothers Band. &amp;nbsp;I talked to him a little and commented about his taste in music; he told me he likes a lot of different genres but will never play punk or folk. &amp;nbsp;While I was in the shop, I noticed he was taking pictures of the records and uploading them to his Taobao shop, which is probably how he gets the majority of his business. &amp;nbsp;I wound up getting a Japanese copy of a Paul McCartney record as well as an American release of something from The Cars, both for 30 RMB each ($4.85/3.89€). &amp;nbsp;As other websites commented, Frank speaks English fluently and he was so kind enough to tell me he would email me when the next shipment of records would arrive. &amp;nbsp;I will obviously be going back.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also decided to try finding Uptown Records again since I knew it was also open. &amp;nbsp;Going on a Friday afternoon, I sought out the random location, finding the little entrance with the sign pointing to the store (see image below) and feeling confident it would be open. &amp;nbsp;I confirmed my initial guess where the entrance was since there was a sign noting that the owner would be back at 3:30 p.m. though it was already closer to 4 p.m. &amp;nbsp;The entrance feels like it's the door to Narnia or something because it's in such a random place; but one thing to note is that there aren't any zoning laws in China separating commercial and residential areas, which is why an arrangement like this is possible. &amp;nbsp;Figuring I didn't feel like coming back again to find it closed again, I decided to wait. &amp;nbsp;Watching all the people go in to the entrance from the street (again, see this image below), I saw a girl about my age go in and not come back out. &amp;nbsp;I thought she might be the person running the store and I was right.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a

style="text-align: center;"&gt;The street entrance to Uptown Records&lt;br /&gt;with the small sign indicating you're at the right place.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;Uptown Records actually takes up the whole basement of the residence building, so it's quite large. &amp;nbsp;The actual space for records takes up about two rooms, which they show on &lt;a href="http://www.uptownchina.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;amp;id=8"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It's a cool store to browse through the bins since there's a mix of old and new records. &amp;nbsp;I was curious about some of the 7" records, so I asked the girl, Sophia, what her favorites were. &amp;nbsp;She asked me what I liked (punk, garage rock, indie rock), and kindly let me play some of them on the record player hooked up in the store. &amp;nbsp;I was the only person there, so I luckily wasn't annoying anyone. &amp;nbsp;The selection there is really varied, ranging from classic rock to indie rock and punk, as well as house, electro, hip-hop, and pop. &amp;nbsp;They also have some old Chinese records, which I didn't look through, though they did look interesting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Generally, it looked like Uptown also hosts events and has a bar area, neither of which were open when I was there. &amp;nbsp;They also sell some secondhand women's clothing that looked really funky, as well as books in Chinese. &amp;nbsp;Like I said, it's quite a big place, but it's not all just vinyl. &amp;nbsp;The new 7" records from local Chinese bands all cost 50 RMB ($8/6.50€), and full-length LPs had a range from about 60 RMB to 200 RMB. &amp;nbsp;To give you an idea, I picked up a an original stereo copy of The Beatles' &lt;i&gt;Something New&lt;/i&gt; for 120 RMB ($19.40/15.57€). &amp;nbsp;So even when you go in to the building and feel like you're going to be murdered, you're actually in the correct place. &amp;nbsp;Here's a picture of the entrance so you know what to look for:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a

style="text-align: center;"&gt;No, you won't get murdered. &amp;nbsp;It's like the door to Narnia, &lt;br /&gt;but this is actually the entrance to Uptown Records.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;In addition to Vinyl Villa and Uptown, I tried finding Movie Star based on the &lt;a href="http://matthayward.com/2013/01/01/buying-vinyl-records-in-shanghai.htm"&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It was pretty out of the way on metro line 9 and about a twenty-minute walk from the stop. &amp;nbsp;This area of Shanghai is definitely not where tourists or expats hang out. &amp;nbsp;All of the residential buildings are low-rise buildings, but not the beautiful old ones you find in the French Concession. &amp;nbsp;There aren't any high-rises like in Pudong and the feel of the city there is what I imagine it to feel like in a less developed city here in China. &amp;nbsp;Lastly, you don't want to be walking around with headphones on because you &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; be run over. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, as cool as it sounded on that blog I found, Movie Star is no longer. &amp;nbsp;The complex of buildings is now four restaurants (one of which is closed), one supermarket, and one massage place:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a

class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Movie Star is unfortunately no longer.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also checked out Kook Music since a lot of the articles I found online had mentioned that it was a pretty cool place. &amp;nbsp;However, that too is unfortunately closed and has now been converted to a real estate agent. &amp;nbsp;I checked out the entry on &lt;a href="http://www.dianping.com/photos/14131277"&gt;Dianping&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Chinese equivalent of Yelp) to see if I was in the right place, and though I didn't get a snapshot of the place, it's definitely not there anymore when I compared the two. &amp;nbsp;Moreover, I tried the website that's in the Dianping photo and the domain seems to be available to buy. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I didn't check out the last store, 2046 Music Record Store, based on the fact that it I read it only sells CDs and DVDs now. &amp;nbsp;Thinking about how technology here is so up to speed, I don't even know if it's still open and didn't feel like trudging out there to have it closed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So to sum it all up, it seems that Vinyl Villa and Uptown Records were the only stores that are still open and selling records that I could find. &amp;nbsp;There was another one I tried to find near the Changshu Road station, but it looked closed and I noticed it was in an area that was mostly for classical music; neighboring stores were all selling cellos, violins, and other classical music instruments. &amp;nbsp;I figured that that probably didn't actually have what I was looking for. &amp;nbsp;Even if only two out of the six shops I wanted to check out are open, I got to discover corners of the city that I would never otherwise visit. &amp;nbsp;I also got to know the metro a little better, and that will always come in use. &amp;nbsp;In the meantime, I'll continue visiting both Vinyl Villa and Uptown, and keep looking on Taobao.com for other records.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Getting to &lt;a href="http://weibo.com/u/3109826857"&gt;Vinyl Villa&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(link is to their Weibo account, which is in Chinese)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Address:&lt;/div&gt;58 Yejiazhai Road, 2F, near Changshou Road&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;叶家宅路58事久市场二楼, 近长寿路&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Take the metro line 7 to Chang Shou Road (长寿路). &amp;nbsp;Take exit 1 at the station if it's open (it wasn't when I was there), and just keep walking straight out of that exit along Changshou Road (长寿路). &amp;nbsp;If not, take exit 7, cross the wide avenue in front of you, turn left, and keep walking straight along Changshou Road (长寿路). &amp;nbsp;When you get to Yejiazhai Road (叶家宅路), turn right. &amp;nbsp;You'll see the whole lights fixture market on the right side. &amp;nbsp;There are multiple entrances. &amp;nbsp;If you go into any of them, there will be a first row of stalls that's parallel to the street. &amp;nbsp;When I looked, there only seemed to be one staircase here, so walk up the staircase. &amp;nbsp;If you look at the image above, I think the staircase is roughly where the big 2 in black and yellow is. &amp;nbsp;At the top of the staircase, you'll see a bunch of TVs and fridges for sale and Vinyl Villa is on the left. &amp;nbsp;It's hard to miss. &amp;nbsp;If it's not open, you'll know you've found it if the gate is down but you'll see some vinyl records hanging outside it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Getting to Uptown Records&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Address:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;115 Pingwu Road, basement, near Xingfu Road&lt;/div&gt;平武路115号, 近幸福路&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Take the metro line 11 or 10 to Jiaotong University (交通大学) and take exit 6. &amp;nbsp;Turn left when you come out of the station and walk along Huashan Road (华山路). &amp;nbsp;Take the first left after the park, which is Pingwu Road (平武路). &amp;nbsp;Number 115 is actually a residential building, but there's a small entrance way next to where the residents go in with small sign letting you know you're in the right place (see image above). &amp;nbsp;It might look completely wrong since there's a bunch of parking spaces and other stuff, but you're in the correct place. &amp;nbsp;Walk down the ramp, hang a left, and then the door to Uptown Records is a red iron door next to a small staircase on your left. &amp;nbsp;If you've walked to the end of the corridor, you've gone too far. &amp;nbsp;If the store is open, the door is open and a light is on. &amp;nbsp;If Uptown is closed, the light won't be on and you might not see the red door because it's kind of dark. &amp;nbsp;See picture above for what the door looks like. &amp;nbsp;Walk down the stairs to the bottom, go through the bunker-like door, and then the rooms with the records is on the left. &amp;nbsp;You'll hear the music.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/4587326238707001711/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies'

about a month, I'm starting to get into the daily grind of living in China. Most of my time is spent job searching, discovering the city, or doing mundane tasks like grocery shopping. The latter two are always an adventure since there's something new I'm going to learn or discover. For most people, shopping online is nothing difficult, but living in a country where my literacy is very limited is a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last few years, I started buying vinyl records again because I like having the physical product. Quite often, new releases also come with an mp3 download code so I can listen on whatever digital device of my choosing. Additionally, I like a lot of music from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, so I just enjoy having the original records, which I have to buy secondhand. About two years ago or so, I went with a friend to Utrecht for the &lt;a href="http://www.recordplanet.nl/en/" target="_blank"&gt;Mega Record &amp;amp; CD Fair&lt;/a&gt; where I looked for a lot of old Beatles records. I realized then that being an avid traveler, I could always go hunt for record shops while on vacation and perhaps find releases that would normally be harder to come by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, I thought that looking for records here in China would be interesting since western music isn't common here, and therefore, if there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; releases that I could find, they're probably rare and/or fewer people are interested in them. Moreover, China is closer to Japan, which comparatively listens to a lot of western music, so finding Japanese releases here is easier than in either Germany or the United States. Having thought this out, I decided to try out &lt;a href="http://www.taobao.com/market/global/index_new.php"&gt;Taobao.com&lt;/a&gt;, China's answer to eBay and Amazon. Essentially, it's an e-commerce site that connects small businesses to people and you can find everything under the sun there, including secondhand wares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EX3sMwpzJ7U/VIWntD6BAPI/AAAAAAAABY0/nb7E3b414VU/s1600/taobao_homepage2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EX3sMwpzJ7U/VIWntD6BAPI/AAAAAAAABY0/nb7E3b414VU/s1600/taobao_homepage2.png" height="191" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My thought process roughly went like this: "I like records. Taobao.com is an e-commerce site...they're all roughly the same, I just enter my search and hit buy." Well, yes, I entered "Beatles LP" and got a bunch of results, which looked like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jFKEjw1dPk4/VIUl4ha0BQI/AAAAAAAABXs/QF79J1VY_Zs/s1600/search_results.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jFKEjw1dPk4/VIUl4ha0BQI/AAAAAAAABXs/QF79J1VY_Zs/s1600/search_results.png" height="242" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;But then I realized, "OH GOD, what are all of these symbols?! And these words?! And filters?!" Maybe not so easy. Thankfully, when I use Chrome and have my VPN turned on, I can let Google just translate everything for me directly in the browser. It's never a great translation and there's usually a lot of gibberish and stuff it can't translate, but I got the idea (I've learned to detest images with text on them since I have to manually enter those into a translator with trackpad handwriting). And thank God there are photos with everything here in China (even in restaurants!) because making a decision is quicker when you can see something visually.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;After browsing for a few hours, I found a Japanese copy of &lt;i&gt;A Hard Day's Night&lt;/i&gt; -- an original, first pressing from 1964, nonetheless! -- for a real bargain of ¥150 (about $24 or 19€). I checked the description translated by Google, and it seemed fine. If it was genuine or not, that was another question. I checked the photo and record number cited, and like I said, all appeared in order. And besides which, an original Japanese first pressing of &lt;i&gt;A Hard Day's Night&lt;/i&gt;! I figured if it turned out to be a dud, 19€ wouldn't be so horrible and I would come away with learning about using a Chinese e-commerce website, plus I'd have something from the Beatles in hand...hopefully.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Thankfully, I found &lt;a href="https://www.techinasia.com/tmall-taobao-english-how-to-guide/"&gt;this incredibly useful guide&lt;/a&gt; in English on using Taobao in Chinese (there's no English site available). Even if the guide simplified the process, it didn't solve all of my issues. For one, it took me more than an hour and a half to figure out registration. Why? Like I already mentioned, I'm a Chrome user and I like using the translate option directly in the browser. However, this means that I'm using a Google product via a VPN; the majority of Google products are blocked here in China due to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shield_Project"&gt;Great Firewall&lt;/a&gt;. If I turn off the VPN, I can't translate anything because the Google server can't be reached. It was a dilemma -- should I turn off the VPN, translate using Bing or Baidu (Chinese search engine) and hope the translation was decent, or leave the VPN on and hope that it didn't "wreak havoc" on the buying process (as the Tech in Asia guide so aptly described)? Well, I tried both, and frankly, both had their issues, which I won't get into specifically.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;It turns out that registering on Taobao requires you to connect your phone, which was a bit unclear to me at first. Unlike in Europe or the U.S. where you have a username and email address, it seems to be a trend here to register with a username and a phone number, while skipping the email address. They leave the option to register with an email though. I found this to be slightly confusing -- did I register with my phone number or an email address? What is this extra field? And then I was having issues with my password. Was it on for phone login or my email? I must've spent at least a half hour figuring out my login and password details, even though it would normally be straightforward.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;The payment options weren't easy to figure out either. &lt;a href="https://www.alipay.com/"&gt;Alipay&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese PayPal equivalent, requires its own plugin to be installed as an extra security measure. For some reason, the plugin doesn't work properly on Chrome, which doesn't really surprise me. I had a really good email conversation with my friend Ningxin to see if she could help me out, which basically consisted of screenshots with remarks like this:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QA-fg0QeXf4/VIUz5fnWaBI/AAAAAAAABYE/X_qkTYGMg0U/s1600/whatisthis.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QA-fg0QeXf4/VIUz5fnWaBI/AAAAAAAABYE/X_qkTYGMg0U/s1600/whatisthis.png" height="207" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Essentially, I couldn't enter a password or a confirmation until I installed the plugin. Luckily, Ningxin was also just as confused as I was because, as she explained, it should work. (Thanks for your help, Ningxin, and sorry to be so annoying!) After installing it and then trying it out on Safari, I could enter a password. Granted, I had to re-register myself because the first time I did, something went wrong, though I have no idea what. By the time I re-registered myself in Safari, I basically had translated it so many times in Chrome already that I knew what each field was without having to use a translator.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;After completing my registration, I put the record in my virtual shopping cart and got to the page where I had to enter my shipping information. At this point, I went back to using Chrome because I needed the translation and I was too lazy to go back and forth between tabs while using Bing or Baidu. The fun part was hoping that I entered my address correctly in Chinese; whereas in Europe and North America addresses go from the smallest to biggest entity (house &amp;amp; apartment numbers, street, postcode/city or city/postcode), it's the opposite here in China. You start off with the city name, then write the district, street, house number, building number, and lastly, apartment number. Not to mention the address is all in one line and not three. Then the question was, "Should I put my English name since that's in my passport? Or should I use my Chinese name?" Solution: I just put both.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;After all of that, figuring out Alipay and making sure I was paying the seller correctly was mostly OK since Alipay and Taobao are the same company. Even so, it was a bit difficult choosing between having a translation + VPN or not. Eventually, I placed the order and could only wait to see what would arrive -- did I enter the address correctly? Did I pay the seller? Did I order the right record?!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-45xRHGnBP-M/VIWGA10P-oI/AAAAAAAABYU/HjztJ3HkgbM/s1600/beatles_record.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-45xRHGnBP-M/VIWGA10P-oI/AAAAAAAABYU/HjztJ3HkgbM/s1600/beatles_record.png" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;As promised according to the terrible Google translation, I received my package within two days of ordering it. And yes, it was the correct record. Sort of. When I opened the package, I looked at the sleeve -- an original cover for the first Japanese pressing of &lt;i&gt;A Hard Day's Night&lt;/i&gt;, number OP-7123. Thrilled, I took out the record itself, saw a few scratches, and checked the number -- OP-7179. Wait, what? I looked again and it turns out the record itself is an original Japanese first pressing for &lt;i&gt;Beatles for Sale&lt;/i&gt;, the record after &lt;i&gt;A Hard Day's Night &lt;/i&gt;(see the photo above, which is from me and more legible than the seller's image). Basically, the record didn't match the sleeve. I checked the photo on Taobao again more carefully and yup, the picture shows the record is &lt;i&gt;Beatles for Sale&lt;/i&gt;. By getting so caught up and worrying about the website and description translations, I missed the simplest thing itself -- the photo!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Neither is probably worth very much without the record and sleeve, but for me, it's now a reminder of figuring out how to use a Chinese e-commerce site. And even then, I'm just happy to have original Japanese Beatles record memorabilia from the 1960s. We'll see what other records I find this year -- in-store or online now that I know how everything works. Who knows, maybe I'll come across a homeless record of &lt;i&gt;A Hard Day's Night&lt;/i&gt; or a &lt;i&gt;Beatles for Sale&lt;/i&gt; sleeve with no record.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/8872606917690512700/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=8872606917690512700&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/8872606917690512700'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/8872606917690512700'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2014/12/figuring-out-chinese-e-commerce-websites.html' title='Figuring Out Chinese E-Commerce Websites'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EX3sMwpzJ7U/VIWntD6BAPI/AAAAAAAABY0/nb7E3b414VU/s72-c/taobao_homepage2.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-4333383500932172507</id><published>2014-11-22T15:50:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-24T09:53:53.910+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='job'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='jobs'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shanghai'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='interview'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='chinese'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='germany'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='CV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='china'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='expat'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='language'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='job process'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='resume'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='languages'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mandarin'/><title type='text'>Job Search &amp; Interviewing Adventures in China</title><content type='html'>I've now been in Shanghai for about four weeks keeping myself busy by looking for jobs -- sending out resumes, going to job fairs, doing interviews, and networking a lot. It's definitely been a learning experience and at times has been surprising, frustrating, and enlightening. There are some commonalities between the United States, Germany, and China, like having to send a CV and cover letter, dressing for success, and all those other things you'll find articles about on LinkedIn. I wound up getting my own business cards printed here because I had read that handing them out here is more common than in the U.S. or Germany. I have to agree that this does seem to be the norm here, but as the last time I was on the job hunt was when I had finished my master's, it's a bit different selling myself with my work experience. But there are three things that I've noticed are very unique to my experience looking for a job here in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;(As a quick side note, I don't have any fitting images to work with this entry, so I'm just adding ones I've taken around Shanghai because they won't end up with other blog entries anyway.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JAWmtSd0f3o/VHCod7JPtLI/AAAAAAAABVc/v3vMClI8OyE/s1600/jin_mao_tower.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JAWmtSd0f3o/VHCod7JPtLI/AAAAAAAABVc/v3vMClI8OyE/s1600/jinmaotower2.jpg" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Looking up at the Jinmao Tower in Lujiazui, the financial district of Shanghai.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. The questionnaire you're given at the beginning of your interview before you meet the interviewer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When you go in for an interview, the first thing that happens here in China is you're given a sheet to fill out with basic information before you talk to the interviewer. The receptionist is usually the one who gives you this thing to fill out before the interview actually begins. I feel like this sheet is just a summary of your CV and cover letter all over again. You enter your contact information, your birthdate, your education, your skills, your last three positions with starting and end dates and occasionally your salary at each position, plus your salary expectation. There's also information I found to be a bit puzzling -- your astrology sign, height, weight, marital status (I don't add this on my CV even in Germany), politics, and your closest family members (including your spouse and parents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For astrology sign, I've written both my western and Chinese astrology signs because I really don't know what to make of it. I mean, if I have to write my birthdate, that would give away both astrology signs. What's the point then? I guess by having a candidate write them, the HR person doesn't need to go figure it out themselves. Even so, I found it an odd piece of information to add, and in this day and age, does it really matter? Every interview I've been to requested this information and I just wonder what they do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found adding my height and weight a bit personal but somehow less odd than astrology sign. This is definitely the American side of me coming out and being slightly offended. I'm definitely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; applying for any modeling jobs or any job where my height or weight would actually matter, like a flight attendant. What difference does my height and weight make? I have no idea, but I've added the information anyway. I'm not ashamed of my height or weight, but I think it's unnecessary information that's not going to make me better or worse at my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marital status is definitely something I don't like having to write. The reason is that at my current age, a lot of people are starting to have kids and frankly, being married, everyone's going to think I'm going to have one now. It's something that the company can easily use to toss out a candidacy, which in the U.S. or Germany is frowned upon (if not illegal), but here in China, I have absolutely no idea. I'm afraid that my marital status in combination with my age will count against me even though I really don't want to have kids right now. I try to make that clear when they ask the question, "Where do you see yourself in three years?" I still wonder, though, if they will remember this fact when they just look at the sheet with all of the information in front of them. Then again, even if the box weren't there on the questionnaire, they often ask me why I'm here in Shanghai. At that point, I say I've been wanting to move to China for awhile (which is the truth), but I also mention it's because my husband's company sent him here. So basically they'd find out my marital status without the questionnaire, but I just hope it doesn't play a huge role in their decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the politics section is definitely for Chinese citizens, so I've actually left it blank. Whether I'm a Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, or in German politics, member of the CDU, FDP, SPD, Die Linke, Die Grünen doesn't make a difference to them. Even so, it's something that would never be on a job questionnaire either in the U.S. or Germany. If it were, I'd be very surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I have no idea what to make about the closest family members section. There have been a few questionnaires where they request these family members' phone numbers. I could understand if this sheet were used when you're hired -- in case of emergency, they'd have your contacts on file. But as a candidate? Again, I just found it a bit strange to collect this information so early in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The questionnaire itself is so detailed that I've needed about 10 to 15 minutes to fill it out. The first time it happened, I wondered if it was just something weird the company did, but after a few more interviews, I've realized it's the norm. To be honest, I find it a bit annoying since I've already gone through the process of making a nice CV and cover letter and then I have to fill out everything again by hand. But hey, if it's the norm, then fine, that's the way it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1uhSEkt6vBY/VHCmOIEZHQI/AAAAAAAABVU/Kat6oUjvRo4/s1600/lujiazui.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1uhSEkt6vBY/VHCmOIEZHQI/AAAAAAAABVU/Kat6oUjvRo4/s1600/lujiazui.jpg" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Part of Lujiazui, the financial district in Shanghai.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;I like the contrast of the modern &amp;amp; old building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. The type of water you're offered to drink&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Of course, when you go in for an interview, you're always offered something to drink. In Germany or the U.S., you're usually given a glass of water. In Germany, you might have the option of carbonated water or still water. However, in both countries, the water you're given is usually cold or at least room temperature. Not so in China -- you're given a cup of boiled to lukewarm water. Coming from a Chinese-American family, I'm not as weirded out by this as someone who has never drunk warm water before in their life. The first interview I went to and got a cup of warm water, I sort of smiled to myself and thought, "Yes, this is very Chinese." Why? Chinese people think drinking something cold is bad for you. My grandparents told me this numerous times; they and my dad also have a tendency to drink boiled water (滾水 is what we say in Cantonese) because it's "good for digestion" and generally just good for you. Admittedly, I will drink hot water once in awhile as well, but I was amused to be given warm water without question at a job interview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when I went to talk to a fellow Middlebury alum, he offered me warm water. I raised an eyebrow and laughed, saying, "Wow, that's very Chinese of you." He told me that having lived here in China for 18 years, he's gotten used to it and going back to the States, he finds it weird to get ice water where ever he goes. When he's there, he requests no ice or maybe a cup of tea where he'll just not use the teabag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yj9qwUWq7B8/VHCmIiKDD_I/AAAAAAAABVE/LxjKW2G_Iks/s1600/centurypark.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yj9qwUWq7B8/VHCmIiKDD_I/AAAAAAAABVE/LxjKW2G_Iks/s1600/centurypark.jpg" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;Florentijn Hofman's Giant Rubber Duck in Century Park attracted hordes of people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Oh, you're Chinese? Of course you speak Mandarin even though we didn't request it specifically in the job ad.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last point is one that's probably going to be repeated in every single entry I write this year in Shanghai -- the expectation that because I've got a Chinese name and look Chinese, I speak Chinese. The first story is when I went to the German-Sino Job Fair, which comprised mostly of German companies looking for Chinese candidates or Chinese companies looking for someone with German experience. The majority of open positions were definitely not in my field; they were all technical, engineering jobs. However, there was one ad for a German-English translator which I thought, "OK, I can do that." I went to the booth for the job and the woman greeted me in Mandarin. I thought, "OK, that's fine," and explained to her &lt;i&gt;in Mandarin&lt;/i&gt; that my Mandarin is not very good. She looked at me blankly and kept talking to me in Chinese. I shook my head, asked, "德语? 英语? 广东话?" ("German? English? Cantonese?") After all, the position was for a German-English translator and there wasn't any Chinese requirement for the job. To be honest, I had no expectation for her to speak English or Cantonese, but at least basic German since it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the German-Sino Job Fair. Eventually, she said something in Mandarin, pointed to my resume in my hand, made the motion of calling, and waved me away. A girl behind me translated, "Give her your CV; she'll call you if she's interested." I handed my resume to her and stalked off. Admittedly, I felt slightly humiliated and hadn't even wanted to give her my CV. Obviously if we can't communicate, they're not going to call me, so why even bother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second story happened at a completely different job interview for an American English Website Editor position where in the job ad, there was nothing written about having to know Chinese. In fact, they specifically requested that the candidate be an American citizen. So obviously, I fit the basic requirement for the position. However, at the interview, the HR woman looked at me and started talking to me in Mandarin. I just smiled at her and explained to her politely in my basic Mandarin that I am an American-born Chinese ("ABC"). Yes, my mother was born in Hong Kong, my dad in New York, and all of my grandparents came from China, but no, my Mandarin is not good enough for a job interview. She spoke basic English which, in my opinion, was probably better than my Mandarin, but she kept slipping back into Chinese. It was a bit frustrating because when I asked her about the actual job, she explained it to me in Chinese, which I didn't completely understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike at the German-Sino Job Fair, this situation wasn't humiliating but rather slightly amusing. I really wonder if the woman would try speaking to an American citizen of non-Asian heritage if they were sitting in front of her -- someone black, white, Latino. What if the candidate were say, Korean-American instead of Chinese-American? For me, it made me think twice about working at the company. Sure, I wouldn't have to deal with HR every day and as long as my direct manager could communicate with me, there shouldn't be any issues. However, if I had issues with my direct manager and had to turn to HR, what would happen then? Of course, I understand that I'm in a country where I don't speak the language and I should be accommodating. But as I mentioned, the job ad didn't specify any Chinese language skills requirement. As a result, I would expect basic English be spoken by key people involved in the hiring process for this particular job. Any job ads in English that mention any Chinese language skills as a requirement basically rule me out and those that write, "Chinese is a bonus," are ones to which I may actually apply depending on everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it's only been four weeks, I'm still waiting to hear back from some companies. Obviously I'm continually applying until I get an offer, but until then, I'm still applying and talking to people. So if you know anyone that needs a project manager in digital communications or a localization manager or coordinator, let me know! In the meantime, I'll also be taking an online CSS class and keeping myself busy with improving my Mandarin so people can stop giving me weird looks.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/4333383500932172507/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=4333383500932172507&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4333383500932172507'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4333383500932172507'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2014/11/job-search-interviewing-adventures-in.html' title='Job Search &amp; Interviewing Adventures in China'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JAWmtSd0f3o/VHCod7JPtLI/AAAAAAAABVc/v3vMClI8OyE/s72-c/jinmaotower2.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-6818606119921143599</id><published>2014-11-08T10:19:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-08T10:22:00.376+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='pledgemusic'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music video'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='records'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='taylor swift'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='vinyl'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='spotify'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ok go'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='pop culture'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='weezer'/><title type='text'>Spotify vs. Taylor Swift vs. The Listener</title><content type='html'>I know that recently I've been posting a lot about moving to Shanghai, but with the news going on regarding Taylor Swift pulling her music from Spotify, I needed to throw my two cents into the conversation and go back to talking about pop culture. &amp;nbsp;So bear with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In case you're living under a rock (or in my case, living in China and a bit far removed from western pop culture news), Taylor Swift released her fifth album this week,    &lt;i&gt;    1989&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;However, the album isn't on Spotify; in fact, she pulled her entire catalog from the streaming service except for one song. &amp;nbsp;She explained: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;"In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently."   &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, her album is setting records, her decision to keep her music off Spotify is being intensely debated, and basically, you can't escape Taylor Swift in the media.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a free Spotify user, I'm torn. &amp;nbsp;I don't actually listen to Taylor Swift, and, wanting to know what the hype was about, I checked out the first single off    &lt;i&gt;    1989&lt;/i&gt;, "Shake It Off." &amp;nbsp;(I keep thinking it should be "Take It Off," but then I remember that was from The Donnas.) &amp;nbsp;Because I can't listen to it on Spotify, I decided to turn to Vevo and watch her music video, which I happily discovered was directed by Mark Romanek:   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nfWlot6h_JM" width="560"&gt;    &lt;/iframe&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The thing is, I don't think any struggling musician or band would be able to simply write off Spotify as an option and just pull their music from the service. &amp;nbsp;Streaming services offer bands a chance to find a new audience that normally wouldn't be accessible to them. &amp;nbsp;Someone like Taylor Swift who has a worldwide audience doesn't need Spotify, and sales of    &lt;i&gt;    1989   &lt;/i&gt;  prove that. &amp;nbsp;In her quote above, she says that the value of an album is based on both the amount of "heart and soul" an artist puts into it and the financial value that is placed on the music. &amp;nbsp;I don't think she is saying that artists who allow their music to be on Spotify put any less effort into their music than she does, but she has the luxury of being able to choose not to share her music with streaming services.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to    &lt;a href="http://time.com/3554468/why-taylor-swift-spotify/" target="_blank"&gt;    this Time article&lt;/a&gt;, artists receive less than 1 cent per streamed play -- between $0.006 and $0.0084. &amp;nbsp;It may not be much, but it can add up when you're Taylor Swift and getting millions of streams per day. &amp;nbsp;For the average band, it's not much.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think part of the problem is that as consumers, we have grown accustomed to the idea that music "is" and "should be" free. &amp;nbsp;Even 30 years ago when radio played a dominant role in how music was heard, people would tune in and not have to pay a dime for listening to it on the radio. &amp;nbsp;To own that single or album, listeners would actually have to go out and buy a physical record, cassette, or CD. &amp;nbsp;Now with digital technology, music is not something tangible. &amp;nbsp;It is just bits of data saved on a computer, a phone, a tablet, an iPod, whatever. &amp;nbsp;There's no work involved with getting music because everything is just a click away. &amp;nbsp;Music is everywhere you go. &amp;nbsp;Remember the days of actually having to choose which CDs or cassettes you wanted to bring with you and not being able to bring your whole collection of music with you on a ten-hour flight? &amp;nbsp;Data is cheap or free (see cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive) and music is now just another form of data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor Swift pulling her music from Spotify isn't going to solve anything. &amp;nbsp;It sure is making a statement, but in the long run, it's not sustainable. &amp;nbsp;If all artists pulled their music from streaming services, piracy would run rampant, which it does anyway. &amp;nbsp;Nothing will change until consumers' attitudes change. &amp;nbsp;We need to be convinced that we should pay for the music and that it's worth paying for it. &amp;nbsp;I personally still buy music and I've actually gone back to buying vinyl recently since many albums come with an additional digital download. &amp;nbsp;I'm more willing to shell out my money if I get both vinyl and digital copies of the album, and no, I don't share my music. &amp;nbsp;Here's two of the albums I bought recently (my most recent purchases are still in Germany while I am here in China):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fCxdgddnWyk/VF3SCtqBdzI/AAAAAAAABUM/3uFmKWz5yrU/s1600/vinyl.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img alt="vinyl" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fCxdgddnWyk/VF3SCtqBdzI/AAAAAAAABUM/3uFmKWz5yrU/s1600/vinyl.jpg" height="298" title="" width="596" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought these albums specifically through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Pledgemusic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;campaigns from &lt;a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/okgo" target="_blank"&gt;OK Go&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/weezer" target="_blank"&gt;Weezer&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Campaigns like these ones&amp;nbsp;make me feel like I'm buying an experience. &amp;nbsp;I'm not just getting the music, but I get the run up to it -- exclusive updates from the band/artist in the form of images and video, access to MP3s before the release, whatever. &amp;nbsp;Some bands have done some really brilliant campaigns and have exclusives like signed albums, special experiences to meet the band, the chance to get your favorite artist to record your voicemail greeting. &amp;nbsp;One of my favorite bands from high school, &lt;a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/nerfherder" target="_blank"&gt;Nerf Herder&lt;/a&gt;, even offered the chance to sing on their album and record in the Lucasfilm Studios. &amp;nbsp;I want to pay for the music because it's an experience. &amp;nbsp;It's not just some digital file that's not tangible. &amp;nbsp;Sure, experiences are just as non-physical as an MP3, FLAC, or WAV, but I think it's something people would be more willing to pay for. &amp;nbsp;Look at this way -- people still go to concerts where they can experience the music, in spite of a steep ticket price. &amp;nbsp;They may bitch and complain about it being a rip-off, but they still go.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically it comes down to this: both the distributors and the artists themselves can't keep thinking about the music industry like it was 30 years ago. &amp;nbsp;It's not working and it won't work. &amp;nbsp;Musicians need to be more creative so that consumers want to pay for the music. &amp;nbsp;Pulling music from Spotify or Pandora or other streaming services will only drive people away from getting the music legally. &amp;nbsp;In Taylor Swift's case, many people have bought her album, but how many more people who would've listened to her music on Spotify are now just downloading it (illegally or otherwise) elsewhere?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was discussing this on Facebook with some high school classmates, and one had the perfect Brian Eno quote to sum this up (thanks, Adam!):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I think records were just a little bubble through time and those who made a living from them for awhile were lucky. There is no reason why anyone should have made so much money from selling records except that everything was right for this period of time...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;It was a bit like if you had a source of whale blubber in the 1840s and it could be used as fuel. Before gas came along, if you traded in whale blubber, you were the richest man on Earth. Then gas came along and you'd be stuck with your whale blubber.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sorry mate – history's moving along. Recorded music equals whale blubber.

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EzM1XBAguHo/VFjXqpQCp5I/AAAAAAAABT0/9i0dXfzi8xU/s1600/pudong2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EzM1XBAguHo/VFjXqpQCp5I/AAAAAAAABT0/9i0dXfzi8xU/s1600/pudong2.jpg" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The skyscrapers are so high, and everything is just so futuristic and &lt;i&gt;shiny&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The Oriental Pearl Tower (the TV tower thing on the left side of the photo) sort of reminds me of what Disneyworld thinks the future should be like in Tomorrowland. &amp;nbsp;If you don't know what I mean, take a look at &lt;a href="https://flic.kr/p/6aQk9q" target="_blank"&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt; I took in 2009 from Hong Kong Disney's Tomorrowland. &amp;nbsp;The Oriental Pearl Tower totally belongs in that weird idea of the future. &amp;nbsp;Next time I get around to taking a picture of the city at night, I'll be sure to post it since I'm positive it will definitely look like Blade Runner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. &amp;nbsp;Shanghai is vast.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, this might be because I'm used to living in tiny little Düsseldorf. &amp;nbsp;But the amount of time it takes me to take a regional train from Düsseldorf to Cologne is about the same time I need &lt;i&gt;just on the subway&lt;/i&gt; to get across town. &amp;nbsp;And it's about just as far! &amp;nbsp;I had to go from the Pudong (eastern side of the river) to the Puxi side near the Shanghai Zoo for a health check. &amp;nbsp;It took me over an hour to get there with the subway and had I taken a cab, probably would've needed just about the same because of traffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Tvu582wEl54/VFi4g2wnSxI/AAAAAAAABTU/-VRj8Cpy5Qg/s1600/puxi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6A7fnSN705I/VFitdEUZjpI/AAAAAAAABS4/_A0cms6wVLM/s1600/with_ningxin.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6A7fnSN705I/VFitdEUZjpI/AAAAAAAABS4/_A0cms6wVLM/s1600/with_ningxin.jpg" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, confusing people with what language I can speak is sort of my life anyway and has been for at least the last eight years. &amp;nbsp;People in Germany always look shocked when I speak German fluently. &amp;nbsp;Maybe not so much in Düsseldorf since there are so many Japanese people around, but I've definitely experienced this surprise firsthand. &amp;nbsp;It comes down to the fact that the expectations are completely different -- in Europe, the expectation is, "You don't have to speak my language because you don't look like me." &amp;nbsp;In Asia, the expectation is, "You should speak my language because you look like me." &amp;nbsp;I think this is a topic that will come up over and over again, but I'll devote another blog entry to it at some point in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I've been learning words really quickly and every day I care less about weirding people out. &amp;nbsp;I just point to what I want to order and say, "I want one of these," or politely explain that I don't know what they're saying when they speak too quickly. &amp;nbsp;Just listening to it, seeing it, hearing it, and trying to speak it every day is letting me make improvements I never would otherwise make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. &amp;nbsp;Food is cheap and plentiful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going hand-in-hand with this observation, I'm going to say this now -- I think I'm going to gain weight this year. &amp;nbsp;There's just so much delicious food everywhere and it's cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't gotten sick of eating Chinese food every day for every meal yet. &amp;nbsp;We'll see how long it takes. &amp;nbsp;After two weeks in India and eating Indian food for every meal that whole time, I couldn't eat Indian food for five months afterward. &amp;nbsp;Actually, I haven't even really eaten Indian food since then. &amp;nbsp;So, we'll see how it goes with Chinese food. &amp;nbsp;But here's some hot pot for you to drool over:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;My last thought about my first impressions is that it's interesting what sorts of things I'm looking for now as an adult seeking employment versus a student fresh in Berlin. &amp;nbsp;For one, I know I wouldn't be able to live off döner if I moved to Germany now or the Chinese equivalent. &amp;nbsp;While walking around the neighborhood that Christian and I will be moving to this weekend, I was excited about the fact that there's an organic supermarket nearby. &amp;nbsp;Yup, student me wouldn't have cared so much. &amp;nbsp;Adult me got really excited. &amp;nbsp;How things change.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/5959507447932322329/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=5959507447932322329&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5959507447932322329'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5959507447932322329'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2014/11/first-impressions-of-shanghai.html' title='First Impressions of Shanghai'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EzM1XBAguHo/VFjXqpQCp5I/AAAAAAAABT0/9i0dXfzi8xU/s72-c/pudong2.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-8009228382638221324</id><published>2014-10-23T06:47:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2014-10-24T13:49:14.964+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='packing'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shanghai'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='germany'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='china'/><title type='text'>Some thoughts about moving to a new country (and packing for it)</title><content type='html'>As I enjoy my last day in Düsseldorf, there are lots of thoughts going through my head. &amp;nbsp;I remember the first time I moved abroad back in 2005 as a college student -- I actually sobbed to my mother for three hours. &amp;nbsp;Maybe more. &amp;nbsp;I recall wailing to her, "But why am I even going abroad?! &amp;nbsp;I feel comfortable where I am and I &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; it here!! &amp;nbsp;What am I &lt;i&gt;doing&lt;/i&gt;?!?" &amp;nbsp;Nine years later, eight of which have been spent outside the U.S., I can only laugh at my college self and think, "How cute." &amp;nbsp;Because honestly, I wouldn't change the last nine years at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the feeling that in Shanghai, I will constantly be comparing it to my German experience. &amp;nbsp;I realize though that this is unfair. &amp;nbsp;Düsseldorf consistently ranks in the top 10 most livable cities in Europe, if not the world, according to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_Quality_of_Living_Survey" target="_blank"&gt;Mercer Quality of Living Survey&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;On the other hand, China ranks as the number one country for expats according to the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20131122-an-expats-home-away-from-home" target="_blank"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;But does living as an expat actually mean a good quality of life? &amp;nbsp;I don't think it necessarily does, but this will probably be one of the bigger questions I answer in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that worries me about living in China is being Chinese-American, but my Mandarin is only so-so. &amp;nbsp;Of course, I'm eager to improve it, but there is an expectation that if you look Asian, you speak the local language. &amp;nbsp;It's a common problem in Asia that I encountered in Beijing, Tokyo, and Kyoto. &amp;nbsp;The attitude is, "Why don't you speak the local language? &amp;nbsp;You're Asian!" &amp;nbsp;This video sums up my experience really well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe align="middle" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oLt5qSm9U80" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;I actually finished packing today and I must say, I'm either getting really good at this moving-abroad-for-a-year-thing or I'm forgetting something. &amp;nbsp;(This is the third time I've moved abroad for a year -- once going to Berlin, once with my CBYX year) &amp;nbsp;I managed to pack one big suitcase that weighs 19.6 kilograms (about 43 pounds) with everything I think I need in it. &amp;nbsp;I've realized that I wear the same stuff over and over again anyway, so if the thought crossed my mind, "Maybe I should pack that because I might actually wear it," the item got left behind. &amp;nbsp;This is what my clothing looked like just laying it out in the living room:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-acXV2rp29PA/VEfL70vVdII/AAAAAAAABQo/TZ56yrleiPM/s1600/WP_20141021_13_40_27_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-acXV2rp29PA/VEfL70vVdII/AAAAAAAABQo/TZ56yrleiPM/s1600/WP_20141021_13_40_27_Pro.jpg" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Whenever it comes to larger trips like this (or rather, just moving temporarily), I take a look at what I want to bring. &amp;nbsp;I considered actually making a chart of how many different combinations I could make -- which pants would go with what top and if I could match a jacket or cardigan to it, plus shoes. &amp;nbsp;I didn't actually wind up making a chart, but I do take that into consideration. &amp;nbsp;Anything that is too specific and can't be combined with anything else doesn't get packed. &amp;nbsp;The only exception is a cocktail dress, which was the dead giveaway that I'm not a student anymore. &amp;nbsp;I actually am bringing it because I thought, "Well, if I get invited to a wedding...or something...I don't feel like shopping." &amp;nbsp;As a student, bringing a cocktail dress never even crossed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After laying it out in the living room neatly, I rolled everything up. &amp;nbsp;I find that rolling everything saves a lot more space and you can cram smaller things like t-shirts into gaps easier than when it's folded. &amp;nbsp;Not only that, but I think my clothes also arrive less wrinkled when rolled. &amp;nbsp;I could be wrong on this, but it's just a feeling. &amp;nbsp;Anyhow, I can definitely fit more rolling everything and if I had actually packed my boots in the photo rather than wearing them, I would stuff them with clothes too. &amp;nbsp;Plus, everything looks more manageable and less scary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B0jXjtl4C_A/VEfL_2smsnI/AAAAAAAABQ0/3mIix6EFBsk/s1600/WP_20141021_19_55_38_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B0jXjtl4C_A/VEfL_2smsnI/AAAAAAAABQ0/3mIix6EFBsk/s1600/WP_20141021_19_55_38_Pro.jpg" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;With the shoes, I packed two pairs of heels, two pairs of boots, two pairs of casual shoes, and my running sneakers. &amp;nbsp;The heels had to be versatile; I can wear them dressed for more formal occasions like putting them with the cocktail dress, but they also had to be not too flashy so I could wear them for work. &amp;nbsp;The boots are very different from each other; as you can see, I have a pair of knee-highs and then ankle boots. &amp;nbsp;Again, they're different from each other but can be worn with a lot of different outfits. &amp;nbsp;As for the casual shoes, they don't take up much space, but I like having different pairs for city trips. &amp;nbsp;And the running sneakers are for the gym (I don't run outside and can't imagine doing so in Shanghai). &amp;nbsp;Generally, I took the largest items and decided that that's what I'll wear on the plane. &amp;nbsp;So it's the knee-high boots, a hoodie, a pair of jeans, shirt, and leather jacket. &amp;nbsp;It saves the space in my bag.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Finally, after I've evaluated everything rolled up, it all goes into the suitcase:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Or expat hoch zwei.</title><content type='html'>It's been awhile since I wrote about being an expat, but it turns out I'm moving to Shanghai on Thursday. &amp;nbsp;Yes, in 72 hours I will be sitting on a plane on my way to China. &amp;nbsp;It's kind of crazy to think that after eight years of living in Germany, I'm moving to a new country and not back to the U.S. &amp;nbsp;I never thought I'd actually have the chance to move to China even though I've been saying I would like to do it for a really long time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might've noticed I've renamed this blog from "Deutschland, na klar!" ("Germany, of course!" which was basically the title of my German grammar book in college) to "Expat Hoch Zwei," which is a mix of English and German. &amp;nbsp;It means "Expat Squared." &amp;nbsp;I actually wanted to rename it "Expat Squared," but doing a quick Google search brought me to another blog that someone else got to before me. &amp;nbsp;Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, tschüß, Düsseldorf:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Nv8gYxNaEy8/VEWAlGl09rI/AAAAAAAABPs/sYKCMWxUyqY/s1600/5509058116_961aaccc32_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Nv8gYxNaEy8/VEWAlGl09rI/AAAAAAAABPs/sYKCMWxUyqY/s1600/5509058116_961aaccc32_o.jpg" height="300" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;The question is...what have I been doing up to now?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;A lot of people have already asked me the question, "Have you already packed?" &amp;nbsp;The answer, simply, is no. &amp;nbsp;I'm not the type of person who takes days to pack. &amp;nbsp;I pretty much will just lay out all of the clothing I think I should or want to take with me. &amp;nbsp;That's usually a big pile of things. &amp;nbsp;Then I'll just look at that pile and take out anything unnecessary, making sure that I have enough clothing for several combinations. &amp;nbsp;Whether it's layering tank tops and sweaters or making sure I have black shoes that match everything, this is the best way to bring very little. &amp;nbsp;Now that I'm moving and need to consider work clothing, I'm also packing completely differently from when I moved to Berlin as a student.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;If I haven't been packing, what have I been doing? &amp;nbsp;I finished working at my last job and tried to tie up as many loose ends as possible. &amp;nbsp;It was bittersweet because I'm excited to embark on a new adventure, but at the same time, I will sorely miss my colleagues. &amp;nbsp;I worked with a lot of incredibly talented and smart people, but we also got along really well on a personal level. &amp;nbsp;To the least, I'll miss the lunchtime conversations that evolved around everything but the product on which we were working. &amp;nbsp;I know I'll keep in touch with all of them since like me, they're all internet geeks and social media makes it easy to make quick updates.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;I've also been worrying about my visa. &amp;nbsp;It reminded me of a few months back when I applied for my Indian visa. &amp;nbsp;Back then, I had to renew my residency permit early because in order to apply for a visa here in Germany instead of in the U.S., I needed to have my German residency permit valid for six months or longer. &amp;nbsp;That wasn't the case, hence the renewal. &amp;nbsp;Long story short, everything was a bit stressful and unfortunately really close to when I actually left to go to India. &amp;nbsp;This time, I happened to have a small trip to Mallorca planned to work from our office there for five days. &amp;nbsp;As a non-EU citizen, I'm technically required to use my passport for flying. &amp;nbsp;I could use my residency permit, but if the airline wanted to, they could demand my passport. &amp;nbsp;So there was nothing I could do but hope everything would fall into place.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;And it has. &amp;nbsp;I applied for my visa last Monday and got my passport back a week later. &amp;nbsp;I've finished getting all of my paperwork in order, cleaned a bunch, and met up with lots of friends. &amp;nbsp;It seemed like it was going to be painfully slow from when I decided, "Yes, I'm going to China!" but it's unsurprisingly sped up so I don't actually have time to think. &amp;nbsp;I need to focus on one thing at a time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;In 72 hours, it'll be 你好， 上海！&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OZV7znurYMU/VEWAsNsyV2I/AAAAAAAABP0/j8HyamK9Xg0/s1600/altAiatcTaXVr5y2Iy0nxxkN9U-rzWzlqj1GZ2rtjvP41v9.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OZV7znurYMU/VEWAsNsyV2I/AAAAAAAABP0/j8HyamK9Xg0/s1600/altAiatcTaXVr5y2Iy0nxxkN9U-rzWzlqj1GZ2rtjvP41v9.jpg" height="300" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/1407728701638360267/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=1407728701638360267&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1407728701638360267'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1407728701638360267'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2014/10/im-going-to-be-expat-squared-or-expat.html' title='I&apos;m going to be an expat squared.

in New York City, which basically discussed what the world can do to slow down climate change. &amp;nbsp;I've always been a green person that's taken interest in the environment, trying to conserve and not produce waste. &amp;nbsp;But I love steak and potatoes. &amp;nbsp;It's one of my favorite meals. &amp;nbsp;When I was in the U.S. this past August, this is what I ate and it was probably one of the best meals I've&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;ever eaten&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tQmSYS2IbuE/VCBlC2ZUTvI/AAAAAAAABEE/J84UZB-rSHY/s1600/WP_20140808_18_38_10_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tQmSYS2IbuE/VCBlC2ZUTvI/AAAAAAAABEE/J84UZB-rSHY/s1600/WP_20140808_18_38_10_Pro.jpg" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I don't regret it one bit. &amp;nbsp;That was a&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;really, really&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;delicious steak. &amp;nbsp;I will admit it -- I like to eat meat. &amp;nbsp;Even so, one particular group that I've become a staunch supporter of is &lt;a href="http://www.meatfreemondays.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Meat Free Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The idea behind the group is simple: the livestock sector (read: meat) is one of the biggest contributors to climate change, and by reducing the amount of meat we consume, we can make a difference. &amp;nbsp;By having one meat-free day per week, we can reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. &amp;nbsp;I've actually gotten so used to not including meat in what I cook that I actually do the reverse -- I eat meat maybe only once a week, if that. &amp;nbsp;So how did a steak &amp;amp; potatoes girl end up eating meat so rarely?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;It was admittedly not easy. &amp;nbsp;Growing up, my parents would always cook something with meat in it: spaghetti bolognese, roast chicken, and steak. &amp;nbsp;In college, I was used to having meat at every meal in the dining hall. &amp;nbsp;Bacon for breakfast, philly cheesesteak for lunch, chicken parm for dinner. &amp;nbsp;(OK, no wonder I gained the freshman 15, but that's a different story.) &amp;nbsp;After graduating, I moved to Germany, where the culinary tradition is mostly connected to sausage, schnitzel, and &lt;i&gt;Schweinshaxe&lt;/i&gt; (pork knuckle). &amp;nbsp;Essentially, a meat-heavy cuisine. &amp;nbsp;And it was actually in this environment that I became more aware of what I was eating, but it didn't happen overnight.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;I'm the type of person who makes a list when I go to the supermarket and I stick to it. &amp;nbsp;To get my list together, I make a menu for the entire week and try to reuse ingredients in multiple dishes to minimize waste, both in terms of food and money. &amp;nbsp;This was a huge challenge, as the majority of dishes I liked to eat mostly had meat in them. &amp;nbsp;So I cut down my meat consumption by one day a week, as advocated by Meat Free Monday. &amp;nbsp;It was fairly easy because I only had to find one recipe per week that was vegetarian. &amp;nbsp;I learned how I could substitute meat with vegetables, beans, and lentils to make the dishes I wanted to cook just as satisfying as their counterparts for carnivores. &amp;nbsp;After awhile, I had a good arsenal of meat-free recipes that I would repeat fairly often and they became regular favorites that my husband and I looked forward to. &amp;nbsp;My red lentil bean chilli soon replaced regular chilli con carne, and a variety of cheeses were on the grill more regularly than cheap sausages. &amp;nbsp;I still ate meat fairly regularly, but I kept collecting more and more recipes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;I also read Jonathan Safran Foer's &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6604712-eating-animals?ac=1" target="_blank"&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/a&gt;, and that put me off eating meat for awhile as well. &amp;nbsp;If you haven't read it, it's a well-researched, thoughtful book about the U.S. meat industry. &amp;nbsp;I won't say too much about it because it's actually self-explanatory. &amp;nbsp;I think the worst story dealt with some slaughterhouse workers who fell into a vat of animal waste because they were overpowered by the stench and drowned. &amp;nbsp;(Yes, there's that much animal waste coming from a slaughterhouse that fills a vat.) &amp;nbsp;But be warned: you'll probably not want to touch meat for awhile. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Then at one point, my (now) husband and I made &lt;i&gt;frikadelle&lt;/i&gt; (meatballs) to serve at his birthday gathering. &amp;nbsp;We bought some ground meat from the butcher since it was a special occasion, but then decided it wasn't enough for the number of guests we were having. &amp;nbsp;He ran out to Rewe, one of the supermarkets around the corner, and picked up 500 grams (about 1 pound) of pre-packaged ground meat. &amp;nbsp;The meat from the butcher was more expensive than the pre-packaged stuff, but we thought it wouldn't make a significant difference. &amp;nbsp;Besides which, the butcher had already closed after we changed our minds about the amount, so we didn't actually have a choice. &amp;nbsp;But man, we were wrong, and I kind of wish we had taken pictures of the differences. &amp;nbsp;The meat from the butcher made these dark brown, delicious-looking meatballs that weren't too greasy on the pan in the oven. &amp;nbsp;The meat from the supermarket, in contrast, was an unappetizing, unhealthy greyish-brown color and left a puddle of grease in the pan. &amp;nbsp;Taste-wise, the meat from the butcher was superior by far because it was less fatty, less watery, and more meaty. &amp;nbsp;We decided at that point to only buy meat from the butcher instead of the pre-packaged stuff from the supermarket's refrigerated aisle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;These three things started to add up. &amp;nbsp;I also noticed that buying meat from the butcher regularly could become a fairly expensive habit. &amp;nbsp;I had gone back to studying to get my master's and was freelancing teaching English. &amp;nbsp;Basically, I wasn't earning a lot of money, so I couldn't really buy meat four times per week from the butcher. &amp;nbsp;With the amount of vegetarian recipes I had collected, I started buying more lentils, beans, and vegetables and actively sought out even more meat-free recipes. &amp;nbsp;If I had a craving for shepherd's pie, I used a recipe with mushrooms and lentils instead. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Soon, it became a habit of making my weekly menu with meat saved only for the weekend. &amp;nbsp;My menu for a week could look like this:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monday - Ricotta &amp;amp; spinach-filled ravioli in a creamy tomato sauce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tuesday - Hearty white bean &amp;amp; quinoa soup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wednesday - Stuffed tomatoes &amp;amp; peppers with rice (see image below)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thursday - Spicy zucchini &amp;amp; cheese&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Friday - Couscous with veggies and a side salad&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saturday - Eggplant cheese bake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sunday - Buffalo wings (because I love chicken wings and there is no vegetarian substitute)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;By supporting Meat Free Monday, the most interesting thing that has happened to me aside from completely changing my eating habits is that I really relish good meat now. &amp;nbsp;It's a treat. &amp;nbsp;("Meat's a treat" sounds like a gimmicky slogan from the 50s, but whatever, it's true.) &amp;nbsp;Whether it's an amazing medium-rare steak like the one above, or it's a juicy Kobe beef burger, it's even more special because I don't eat meat so often in general. &amp;nbsp;Sure, you could argue that I could buy meat from the butcher frequently and appreciate a good steak in a restaurant, but that's not what I choose to do because of the environmental and financial cost. &amp;nbsp;I could also get into the health benefits like lower cholesterol and all that, but for me, they play a smaller role.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bcgXeqsBkZo/VCBlCzbDYTI/AAAAAAAABEA/1ww7X1R2TIY/s1600/WP_20140922_19_32_20_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

I actually just listen to the music and don't look out for them in the media. &amp;nbsp;And this is probably what my problem was because when Debbie Harry came out on stage, I thought to myself, "Whoa, Debbie Harry is old!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you tell me I'm a raging idiot and &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; Debbie Harry is old, let me clarify why this came to me as a surprise. &amp;nbsp;Debbie Harry's face is so tightly bound to Blondie's image that when the band was getting popular back in the day, everyone actually thought Debbie Harry's name was Blondie (it wasn't, and there was a campaign from the band with buttons that said, "Blondie is a group.") Everyone knows what Debbie Harry looked like in the 70s because she graces t-shirts and other items as modern vintage. &amp;nbsp;At the concert, they were also selling t-shirts with her face on it, but it was an image from the 70s, not from now. &amp;nbsp;Even if I google "Debbie Harry Rolling Stone," the search results show a German cover from July 2011. &amp;nbsp;And guess what? &amp;nbsp;It's not Debbie Harry as how she currently looks, but what she looked like 40 years ago: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.deborah-harry.com/press/scans/rolling/02.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://www.deborah-harry.com/press/scans/rolling/02.jpg" height="320" width="245" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, the lead article is, "35 Years of Punk," along with "The Myth of Debbie Harry - Meeting with the Punk-Pop Goddess" and "Blondie - The New Album." &amp;nbsp;Although two out of the three articles deal with Debbie Harry &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;, Rolling Stone chose to feature her image &lt;i&gt;from the 70s&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It's only when you look inside that you see what she currently looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare this with the Rolling Stones or Black Sabbath, both of whom I saw within the same week that I went to see Blondie. &amp;nbsp;Everyone knows what Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and Ozzy Osbourne looks like today. &amp;nbsp;We recognize them immediately and know that they're old. &amp;nbsp;When I google "Rolling Stones Rolling Stone" or "Black Sabbath Rolling Stone," I get these images in the top search results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table style="width: 100%px;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

The Rolling Stones' cover is from May 2013, and the Black Sabbath one is from September 2013 (note that it is the Spanish edition). &amp;nbsp;Granted, these are heavily photoshopped and I can tell you this because I literally just saw both bands in the last week and a half. &amp;nbsp;The point though is -- you know they're old and you're not surprised to see them looking as they should because yes, they're over 65 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to the point that I think it's a bit sexist that Debbie Harry's image from the 70s is still being used. &amp;nbsp;Granted, it might be of the band's choice, but I think it's also a bit of societal pressure. &amp;nbsp;Clothing for little girls mimics items made for older girls or even women, but then as soon as you hit a certain age, society tells women that we should all look younger. &amp;nbsp;Heaven forbid we all actually look our age! &amp;nbsp;Girls make themselves up to look older and wear clothing that makes them look a certain age, but then women also make themselves up to look younger. &amp;nbsp;There are products galore out there to make you look that perfect age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debbie Harry is, as Rolling Stone pointed out, a punk-pop goddess. &amp;nbsp;She did a lot for MTV back in the day, and she is a role-model for a lot of women in rock. &amp;nbsp;Blondie as a band needs to stop using her image from the golden age of MTV. &amp;nbsp;They're still a great band making phenomenal music. &amp;nbsp;Having to rely on Debbie Harry's image from the 70s is sending the wrong message to girls and women in rock today -- we can't get old and we must be eternally, youthfully beautiful. &amp;nbsp;She and the band should really embrace her image now; she can still rock and she is beautiful the way she is. &amp;nbsp;And to underline this point, this is what she looked like at the concert I went to in Cologne:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XYZEL6-Xdw0/U7B3FI1U_MI/AAAAAAAABBQ/GBvAhGcPnU8/s1600/Jeremy_20140625_21_22_51_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z3GVD9bHnZw/U52LoDcPPKI/AAAAAAAAA_8/rnL33SgR5Sk/s1600/Jeremy_20140502_19_55_50_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z3GVD9bHnZw/U52LoDcPPKI/AAAAAAAAA_8/rnL33SgR5Sk/s1600/Jeremy_20140502_19_55_50_Pro.jpg" height="225" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

I was certainly one of the few people there alone. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;The hosts were Brian Kehew and Kevin Ryan, authors of the book &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6604896-recording-the-beatles" target="_blank"&gt;Recording the Beatles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with guest Ken Scott, who was an engineer that worked with The Beatles.&amp;nbsp; The talk actually revolved mostly around Abbey Road Studios and its contribution to musical history and the developments of recording technology, like the development of stereo, how master recordings were made, and the differences between the three studios in Abbey Road. &amp;nbsp;Of course, The Beatles played an enormous role with their experiments and pushing the boundaries of what was feasible. &amp;nbsp;I don't actually have any sort of photos or recordings of the talk itself because it was forbidden since Kehew, Ryan, and Abbey Road Studios wanted to keep the content exclusive, which I can fully understand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;When Ken Scott talked, he mostly described how it was working with The Beatles, how he accidentally wound up as an engineer, and had lots of fascinating little anecdotes. &amp;nbsp;For example, the snare drum hit on the song "Glass Onion" in the beginning and in the middle are two completely different ones though they were supposed to be the same. &amp;nbsp;He tried so hard to get the recording right, and it just didn't work. &amp;nbsp;The Beatles didn't really care. &amp;nbsp;Or how he made some off-hand comment about recording in a small closet off Studio Two and two days later, The Beatles decided to record "Dig a Pony" in it, which gave it a very enclosed, tight sound. &amp;nbsp;To say the least, I was hanging off every word he said.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;The highlight of actually being in Abbey Road Studio Two, though, was listening to music in the actual studio. &amp;nbsp;Naturally, being the most famous recording studio in the world, they had amazing speakers there and the acoustics were fantastic. &amp;nbsp;A small clip of The Beatles' version of "Twist and Shout" was played and it was incredible. &amp;nbsp;The sound was so clear and crisp that it was like being in the studio with them. &amp;nbsp;I could just imagine them standing in the corner going wild recording the song. &amp;nbsp;In the photo above, that's the corner where they always stood. &amp;nbsp;And this is their point of view of the studio:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qhl6rZVtOwc/U52Qkm8YlGI/AAAAAAAABAM/8nIHhK40H0U/s1600/Jeremy_20140502_22_06_07_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;In addition to listening to clips, Kehew and Ryan asked the audience if anyone played piano (my reaction: "Dammit, why didn't I ever learn to play piano instead of trumpet?!"). &amp;nbsp;They took three people and sat them down on a few pianos they had (see image below). &amp;nbsp;These pianos are always in Abbey Road Studios and they have different timbres. &amp;nbsp;One dating from 1905 has an exceptionally bright sound that would be great for ragtime and Paul McCartney had used it for "Ob-la-di Ob-la-da." &amp;nbsp;The famous Steinway was also in the corner. &amp;nbsp;These three lucky people were instructed by Kehew and they simultaneously struck a very, very famous chord -- the chord at the end of "A Day in the Life." &amp;nbsp;The sound reverberated throughout the studio, slowly faded out, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who got chills. &amp;nbsp;I could just imagine John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Mal Evans, and George Martin all playing this at the end and letting it ring, so much so that you can hear Ringo's chair squeak ever so slightly in the remastered version. &amp;nbsp;Nobody had to be told what the chord was; everyone recognized it immediately.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lm2scfsC8i0/U52Vnl1ABbI/AAAAAAAABAk/3TppLiAN9ZY/s1600/Jeremy_20140502_22_05_32_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;The ability though to be in the place where The Beatles recorded all of their albums, to be able to listen to their music in the place where they were, to hear Ken Scott's stories about working with The Beatles, was worth every cent. &amp;nbsp;It was a truly remarkable experience and I am so glad I was able to do it. &amp;nbsp;Even hearing about how technology developed in Abbey Road Studios was fascinating and it's definitely given me a better appreciation of music in general. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

(For example, see Jack White getting the title of recording &lt;a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jack-white-releases-worlds-fastest-record-20140419" target="_blank"&gt;the world's fastest record&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, the list of records I wanted to get included Ray Parker, Jr.'s "Ghostbusters" single on glow-in-the-dark green vinyl, a Sharon Jones &amp;amp; The Dap Kings 12", two Everly Brothers 12", a Yardbirds 12", The Pixies' release &lt;i&gt;Indie Cindy&lt;/i&gt;, and any of the Rancid re-releases. &amp;nbsp;(Just a note -- this a shortened list of things I wanted. &amp;nbsp;If I included everything I wanted, it'd be significantly longer.) &amp;nbsp;I wound up getting lucky with &lt;i&gt;Indie Cindy&lt;/i&gt; and two Rancid releases, &lt;i&gt;Let's Go&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;...And Out Came the Wolves&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;With the Pixies, I was pretty excited since the release is limited and included a surprise 7" inside that's exclusive for RSD. &amp;nbsp;As for Rancid, I only own the albums digitally, so I figured it'd be a good idea to get them on vinyl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/recordstoreday"&gt;@recordstoreday&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RSD_Germany"&gt;@RSD_germany&lt;/a&gt; Happy &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RSD&amp;amp;src=hash"&gt;#RSD&lt;/a&gt;!

The difference between RSD and Black Friday though is that I don't stuff myself silly with food the day before. &amp;nbsp;Also, I actually participate every year. &amp;nbsp;With Black Friday, I avoid it like the plague, but with RSD, it's not just about getting my hands on some records. &amp;nbsp;It's about the community and hearing other like-minded music lovers talking enthusiastically about their favorite bands and albums. &amp;nbsp;It's also about going supporting the local record shop because they can make recommendations and have a great conversation. &amp;nbsp;Sure, you can just switch on Spotify or Pandora, discover bands, and share them, but it's behind a computer screen (Ironic that I say this considering I'm sitting here writing about it at my computer). &amp;nbsp;And if I were in New York, it'd also be about the live performances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Record Store Day is about being analog and about the community. &amp;nbsp;It's nice to see that even in this day and age, people still want to something physical in their hands and they want to have that human interaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for shits and giggles since this has been making the rounds...Kids React To Walkmans:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Uk_vV-JRZ6E" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/4989005027604246936/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=4989005027604246936&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4989005027604246936'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4989005027604246936'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2014/04/record-store-day-is-my-black-friday.html' title='Record Store Day is my Black Friday'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-2823887079690444271</id><published>2014-04-18T22:58:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2014-04-20T12:59:11.062+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='game of thrones'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='pop culture'/><title type='text'>The inevitable post about Game of Thrones</title><content type='html'>As much as I consider myself a pop culture fanatic, I also get into TV shows considerably later than everyone else. &amp;nbsp;Consider that I got into &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt; after their second seasons had already aired and finished on TV. &amp;nbsp;And I'll admit it -- I have never seen an episode of &lt;i&gt;Breaking Bad &lt;/i&gt;or&lt;i&gt; Downtown Abbey,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;watched only two episodes of &lt;i&gt;The Walking Dead &lt;/i&gt;(which I liked), and only started watching &lt;i&gt;30 Rock&lt;/i&gt; in earnest this year, which is a shame because it is simply hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And then there's &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

was not that enthusiastic and after reading the &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/719731651" target="_blank"&gt;fifth book&lt;/a&gt;, I still haven't warmed to the series.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As for the show, I had watched a few episodes and again, was not super excited to watch it. &amp;nbsp;In fact, I kept having the tendency of falling asleep. &amp;nbsp;"But how?!" you scream. &amp;nbsp;It took me a really long to stop falling asleep while watching &lt;i&gt;The Godfather &lt;/i&gt;and realize how brilliant of a film that is, so maybe this the same.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, I'm forcing myself to watch this season because I've already read the books. &amp;nbsp;More importantly, it's for the water cooler talk. &amp;nbsp;God, I can't escape it. &amp;nbsp;Even though season four is only two episodes in, it's &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;everywhere&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I can't be the annoying person that asks, "So, did that happen in the latest episode? &amp;nbsp;Oh, did I just spoil something? &amp;nbsp;Uh, sorry." &amp;nbsp;Because that's what will inevitably happen and has happened for the past two weeks. &amp;nbsp;True, I could just read the reviews for experts on &lt;a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/game-of-thrones-experts/" target="_blank"&gt;The AV Club&lt;/a&gt; and that would save me the hour of watching the show, but then I feel like I'm raining on everyone's parade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Stop reading here if you don't want to read any spoilers. &amp;nbsp;I mean it. &amp;nbsp;I'm bringing in stuff from the books.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I suppose this season of &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; will also be my favorite considering I liked the third book the most. &amp;nbsp;Aaaaaaand spoiler alert -- there's lots of deaths. &amp;nbsp;Is it weird that I'm looking forward to them? &amp;nbsp;Joffrey's death in the second episode of season four was one of those, "Hell yeah!" TV moments. &amp;nbsp;I was wondering if that would happen in the first episodes, and I'm glad that the writers hadn't pushed it towards later in the season. &amp;nbsp;I also can't wait for Tywin and Shae to die and see Peter Dinklage's acting in that particular scene. &amp;nbsp;He has added a lot of subtlety to the character that is probably one of the main reasons that I haven't said, "Screw the water cooler talk" yet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With only ten episodes per season, I will probably be watching it, but &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; definitely has lower priority than &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On a related note, &lt;a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/professor-suspended-game-thrones-shirt-threatened--203579" target="_blank"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about a professor at a community college near my hometown who was arrested because, as the AV Club put it, his shirt "threatened community college kingdom," makes me cringe. &amp;nbsp;I so don't want to be that person who doesn't get really obvious pop culture references.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/2823887079690444271/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=2823887079690444271&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2823887079690444271'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2823887079690444271'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2014/04/the-inevitable-post-about-game-of.html' title='The inevitable post about Game of Thrones'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_0lvOE4cCsc/U1GKWwiEMXI/AAAAAAAAA9A/xXI8dpEwDpA/s72-c/Screen+Shot+2014-04-18+at+10.25.18+PM.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-4195452936040984823</id><published>2014-04-06T18:00:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2014-04-20T12:59:26.162+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='how i met your mother'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='himym'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='pop culture'/><title type='text'>The series finale of HIMYM: It's not about the mother, it's about the how</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;If you know me, you'll know that I watch only two shows on a regular basis -- &lt;i&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Both of these shows are ending this year and the expectations for both are incredibly high.&amp;nbsp; The series finale of &lt;i&gt;How I Met Your Mother &lt;/i&gt;aired last week on March 31.&amp;nbsp; I didn't have time to watch it until Friday, so I might be slightly behind on jumping on the commentary bandwagon.&amp;nbsp; I actively avoided Twitter (we know how much that can &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.de/2013/05/how-social-media-is-ruining-tv-for-me.html" target="_blank"&gt;spoil stuff&lt;/a&gt; for me), but unfortunately following the show on Google+ made me want to tear my hair out with this (I mean, seriously, there's so little stuff on Google+, who would've thought it would spoil a bunch):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cVIeF-pDBt4/U0FDq8srIpI/AAAAAAAAA7k/9Qc552Qs6jw/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-04-06+at+2.07.36+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cVIeF-pDBt4/U0FDq8srIpI/AAAAAAAAA7k/9Qc552Qs6jw/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-04-06+at+2.07.36+PM.png" height="313" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas, I digress...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series finale seems to have been disappointing to just about everyone.&amp;nbsp; The basic reaction was, "It took you a whole season to get Barney &amp;amp; Robin married only to get them divorced in two minutes, then have nine seasons to get Robin &amp;amp; Ted get together?&amp;nbsp; What the hell!" or, "The show is called &lt;i&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/i&gt;, and the mother just dies?!" I get it.&amp;nbsp; I didn't like it at first, but then I thought about it and actually thought the finale was fitting.&amp;nbsp; So here's a breakdown of how I thought about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ted, The Mother, &amp;amp; the notion of "How I Met Your Mother"&lt;/h3&gt;Fans have been anticipating the moment when Ted meets the Mother for nine years and it should have been extraordinary.&amp;nbsp; We're talking about Ted Mosby, after all, the guy we've come to know who makes these grand gestures all in the name of love.&amp;nbsp; He's the one who just blurts out, "I think I'm in love with you!" on a first date.&amp;nbsp; The moment that Ted meets the Mother (who we learn is named Tracy) is actually not this huge big deal.&amp;nbsp; They casually talk about things that make it seem like the universe has brought them together -- Tracy was Cindy's roommate, Tracy was in the econ class that Ted thought was his architecture course, the yellow umbrella.&amp;nbsp; It's actually a very sweet moment, and, considering that this moment has been built up in the last nine years, is fitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finale then fast-forwards and we see how Ted and Tracy's relationship develop.&amp;nbsp; We've seen glimpses in this final season, but we really get to see what happens.&amp;nbsp; Instead of having the fairy-tale wedding that we'd all expect these two kids to have, it turns out that Tracy is pregnant and they put the wedding off.&amp;nbsp; In fact, they put the wedding off quite awhile because they have a second kid, and well, time just doesn't allow for it.&amp;nbsp; Future Ted tells his kids that he learned to treasure every moment he had with Tracy, to love her fully, and to appreciate that he had her in his life, even through the trying time when she got sick.&amp;nbsp; Then we find out that Tracy died six years previous to Future Ted's storytelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's when I think the majority of people say, "But why!"&amp;nbsp; I thought about it, and sure, it's not a happy ending, especially for a sitcom.&amp;nbsp; However, &lt;i&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/i&gt; is a sitcom that has always mixed the absurd (think: slap bet) with the dramatic (think: Marshall's dad's death).&amp;nbsp; I think the show has always balanced this well, and when it comes down to it, that's what's so charming about it.&amp;nbsp; We've learned to love these characters through the good and bad times, and through it all, you realize that what happens to these characters can also happen to you and your friends.&amp;nbsp; Ted has gone through so much to meet Tracy that he really knows how to fully love her and appreciate her.&amp;nbsp; Without going through what he did (how many times did his heart get broken?), he wouldn't have reached the point where he could be the person he was when he met the mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings me then to the show's title: &lt;i&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Many fans have argued that the show is about Ted meeting the Mother.&amp;nbsp; I agree, it is, but only to a point.&amp;nbsp; I think people focus on the "mother" in the title, but it shouldn't be.&amp;nbsp; The focus should be on the "how" and I really have &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2013/05/why-i-like-watching-how-i-met-your.html" target="_blank"&gt;always thought this&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The vast majority of the show's stories revolve around the gang -- Ted, Robin, Barney, Marshall, and Lily.&amp;nbsp; There are story lines that lead to the moment when Ted meets the Mother, like all of the yellow umbrella moments, getting to know Cindy, everyone's encounters with the Mother before Ted.&amp;nbsp; But when it comes down to it, the show is not actually about meeting the Mother, but the story of a few friends going through their 20s and 30s in New York City.&amp;nbsp; Some may argue that it all leads to the Mother, and it does.&amp;nbsp; What happens in the past is what makes Ted who he is when he meets the Mother, but that moment isn't the defining point in the show.&amp;nbsp; It's everything that happens before he meets the Mother that's important.&amp;nbsp; The show has never been about this one particular moment, but it's been about the journey.&amp;nbsp; I can hear some of my friends telling me that I'm being sappy, but all of the stories that we associate with the show have nothing to do with the Mother -- Robin Sparkles, Slap Bet, Big Fudge, what does Barney actually do for a job?!, Lily's wisdom, Intervention -- they are all about the gang. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that we finally get to know the Mother's name and we get to see the moment that Ted meets her is satisfying.&amp;nbsp; But was the series finale really only about that?&amp;nbsp; I think I would've been disappointed if the show had ended with Robin &amp;amp; Barney happily married, we see Ted and Tracy meet, the end.&amp;nbsp; Life is unpredictable, and &lt;i&gt;How I Met Your Mother &lt;/i&gt;doesn't go for the fairytale ending, which would've been a far safer way to end the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last point regarding Ted and the Mother is that their stories actually parallel each other quite well.&amp;nbsp; At the beginning of season nine, we learn of Tracy's heartbreak when the love of her life dies in an accident.&amp;nbsp; She isn't ready to start dating, but winds up in a relationship where the guy doesn't really seem to get her.&amp;nbsp; We don't know her story like we do Ted's, but she has been carrying around the grief of losing the love of her life and still can't let go, even when she gets a proposal.&amp;nbsp; But it is exactly this point that makes her ready to meet Ted -- she has experienced loss, she had another marriage proposal, but couldn't go through with it.&amp;nbsp; I asked myself if Tracy is "settling" when she meets Ted.&amp;nbsp; We don't know her full story, after all, but they seem made for each other.&amp;nbsp; Later, Ted loses the love of his life -- Tracy, aka the Mother -- and then goes back to Robin.&amp;nbsp; Is he "settling," the way Tracy might've because the love of her life died?&amp;nbsp; Is everyone in the show "just settling?"&amp;nbsp; Is this how life actually is?&amp;nbsp; (Maybe.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Robin, Barney, and Ted&lt;/h3&gt;A lot of people have also complained that the final season was devoted to getting Robin and Barney hitched, only to have their marriage dissolve in a two-minute scene.&amp;nbsp; But let's face it...did anyone really think that Robin and Barney getting married seem like a plausible idea?&amp;nbsp; I didn't like that season nine took all of the characters out of familiar settings, like McLaren's and the apartment, but the writers still used the devices they've honed in the last eight years to connect the dots.&amp;nbsp; Throughout season nine, we've gotten a closer look at how Robin and Barney seem to have been made for each other, but then there were always doubts.&amp;nbsp; Barney's last hurrah and teaching those two helpless college guys "how to live" was a signal that maybe Barney hadn't changed.&amp;nbsp; His gesture of bringing Canada to the rehearsal dinner was romantic and a nice touch, but it seemed something that would've been out of Ted's book, not the Playbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there was a lot of protesting when Robin and Barney got engaged.&amp;nbsp; So why all the fuss when they get divorced?&amp;nbsp; Going back to the point I made above that &lt;i&gt;HIMYM&lt;/i&gt; has always balanced the absurd with the realistic, this goes directly hand in hand with that idea.&amp;nbsp; Did anyone really expect to have these two stay together?&amp;nbsp; Did we really believe that Barney could change so dramatically?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One part of the series finale I admittedly didn't particularly like was that Barney ends up getting a woman pregnant and has a daughter.&amp;nbsp; But in the grand scheme of things, it's been surprising that Barney &lt;i&gt;hasn't&lt;/i&gt; gotten anyone knocked up until now.&amp;nbsp; And perhaps this is what he needs to truly change.&amp;nbsp; Robin couldn't do it because he obviously felt trapped, but having a daughter puts things into perspective for him.&amp;nbsp; I don't want to speculate beyond what the series has given us, but again, Barney getting someone pregnant doesn't seem too unrealistic.&amp;nbsp; There are these real moments in life where we all think, "Oh, shit," and this is probably that moment for Barney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Ted and Robin actually finally getting together once the Mother has died, Robin has been around the world and divorced from Barney...I understand why some fans think, "It took them nine years to explain this?"&amp;nbsp; But sometimes things don't work out the way they're "supposed" to.&amp;nbsp; We all know this feeling.&amp;nbsp; There are missed chances, regrets, what-ifs, I-should-haves.&amp;nbsp; If this entire final season had been about Ted getting back together with Robin, that would've been so boring.&amp;nbsp; We know their story, and frankly, it's one about missed chances.&amp;nbsp; Maybe it's just me, but there were so many times throughout the show where I would be smacking my forehead and yelling at the TV, "Ted, you're too good for Robin!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bringing this back to focusing on the "how" part of the show's title, it's really about the journey.&amp;nbsp; Robin wasn't ready to have Ted.&amp;nbsp; She needed to experience disappointment before appreciating what she had.&amp;nbsp; Lucky for her, Ted still wanted her after he had the perfect match.&amp;nbsp; Sure, people make dumb mistakes and yes, it's kind of maddening that it takes nine years plus the additional six or seven for Robin to realize that she should be with Ted, but...life is never what we expect it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;And finally....Lily &amp;amp; Marshall&lt;/h3&gt;It's not surprising that Lily and Marshall end up having three kids.&amp;nbsp; They're totally the "mature" people in the gang and seem to have their shit together.&amp;nbsp; I found it profound when Robin says to Lily that some things can't stay the same and that the gang isn't the same as it once was.&amp;nbsp; It's a hard but honest truth, and I'm sure some people were like, "Wait a second, what???"&amp;nbsp; Nothing really ever stays the same, and when it does, it's like Barney and everyone just think it's sort of sad.&amp;nbsp; Change happens and it's an undeniable force.&amp;nbsp; As much as you may want something to remain the way it is, it's not going to happen.&amp;nbsp; And we see that in the relationships in the series finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, things may happen the way we want it to, like Marshall getting offered a judgeship after turning down the first one.&amp;nbsp; But how often does that actually happen?&amp;nbsp; Though Lily and Marshall seem to be the adult couple in the group, they've had more than their share of ups and downs.&amp;nbsp; I think fans had the least problem with how the series ties up the loose ends with Lily &amp;amp; Marshall, so I'll just leave it as that.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oh, the geeky stuff!&lt;/h3&gt;The last point I actually wanted to address about why I liked the finale so much were the inside jokes and the storytelling devices.&amp;nbsp; The finale was chock full of references to past seasons: "Major Pleasure" with Ted and Robin, the "Haaaaave you met Ted?" line, Ted's hanging chad Halloween costume, the cockamouse, Robots vs. Wrestlers...That's one thing I really loved most about this show.&amp;nbsp; You could watch it as a casual viewer, but as a devoted fan, there would be these references slipped in that would make you appreciate the story that much more.&amp;nbsp; It's funny if you watch an individual episode, but way more rewarding to watch it from beginning to end.&amp;nbsp; The writers didn't disappoint with these jokes and it was almost as if they're giving you a small wink and thanks for sticking around so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there's the flash-forwards and going backwards that have always been a really fantastic part of the show.&amp;nbsp; Of course, this was the series finale, so flash-forwards were to be expected.&amp;nbsp; What was nice about this though was that it didn't seem contrived or forced, but was completely natural and fit into the whole show.&amp;nbsp; The flash-forwards could've been totally overdone to tie up every loose end (What's with the pineapple?!), but I think everything that you wanted to know was answered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the series finale wasn't as disappointing as some other shows' (umm....&lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt;, anyone?) and I think it begs to be watched multiple times.&amp;nbsp; I can't wait for the show to be out on DVD completely because I'll probably just hole myself up to go back and enjoy all the jokes.&amp;nbsp; Now that we know who the Mother is and how the story ends, I'm sure there's a lot of nuggets and clues that can be found (like the fact that in season one, &lt;a href="http://www.buzzsugar.com/How-I-Met-Your-Mother-Past-References-Series-Finale-34492598#photo-34492895" target="_blank"&gt;Ted meets a stripper named Tracy&lt;/a&gt; and jokes how that's how he met the mother?)&amp;nbsp; And now apparently there might be an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CarterBays/statuses/452299544995184640" target="_blank"&gt;alternate ending&lt;/a&gt; that will be released, so we'll just have to wait and see.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/4195452936040984823/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=4195452936040984823&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4195452936040984823'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4195452936040984823'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2014/04/why-i-actually-liked-series-finale-of.html' title='The series finale of HIMYM: It&apos;s not about the mother, it&apos;s about the how'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cVIeF-pDBt4/U0FDq8srIpI/AAAAAAAAA7k/9Qc552Qs6jw/s72-c/Screen+Shot+2014-04-06+at+2.07.36+PM.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-235161135780946763</id><published>2014-02-01T22:50:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-02-01T22:50:36.415+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='mooc'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='concerts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music video'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='rock music'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='rock'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='rock &amp;

I asked a lot of different people if they want to come with me, and the general reaction I get when I posed this question was raised eyebrows.&amp;nbsp; Apparently I don't come off as a Lady Gaga fan because I am definitely a rock fan, not pop.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Truth be told, I only really became a fan after studying her closely for my master's thesis on music videos.&amp;nbsp; (Have you seen the videos for "Paparazzi" and "Telephone" in succession?&amp;nbsp; No?&amp;nbsp; Do it.)&amp;nbsp; The more I thought about it, the more I realized that Lady Gaga actually could fall under the umbrella of "rock and roll," which is why I like her so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EVBsypHzF3U" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the fall and winter last year, I took a MOOC on &lt;a href="http://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, The History of Rock &amp;amp; Roll, taught by The University of Rochester's John Covach.&amp;nbsp; I did it to better understand the genre and the history and out of pure interest.&amp;nbsp; One particular aspect that continually came up was what Covach called the "hippie aesthetic," which arose in the late 1960s and consisted of the following elements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serious lyrics.&amp;nbsp; Topics weren't about teen life and romance, but dealt with spirituality, the terror of war, etc.&amp;nbsp; Essentially, it's the difference between The Beatles' songs "Please Please Me" and "Tomorrow Never Knows."&amp;nbsp; One is about teen love, the other is more spiritual (ok, yes, it's also rather trippy, but that's what happened).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serious music.&amp;nbsp; The actual music was inspired by other styles, like classical and jazz, which were considered less mainstream and more worthy of respect.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, this meant that artists were not just artists, but also musicians with virtuosity.&amp;nbsp; They were good at playing their instruments and really mastered them.&amp;nbsp; Think of Jimi Hendrix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The use of technology.&amp;nbsp; In the late 1960s, there were so many new technologies developing, and those that fell under the "hippie aesthetic" embraced them.&amp;nbsp; This included the use of more tracks, the use of technology and the studio as an instrument, and the use of synthesizers.&amp;nbsp; One good example here would be Phil Spector's Wall of Sound.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this together made for an authentic image.&amp;nbsp; The artist wrote their own songs based on their own experience and played their own instruments.&amp;nbsp; It's the difference between The Monkees and The Beatles (don't get me wrong, The Monkees also made their contribution to music history and there are definitely songs, but their original concept was very manufactured).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turning back to Lady Gaga, you might be thinking, "Well, how the hell does this apply to her?"&amp;nbsp; Yes, there are the pop songs that don't really deal with anything that could be considered "serious."&amp;nbsp; There are countless examples: "Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" "Just Dance," "Bad Romance" (basically, a lot of songs off her first album).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are also examples that are about her personal experience and are less about the idea of love (and since it's 2014, sex).&amp;nbsp; She's said that "The Edge of Glory" was about her grandfather's death and the impact it made on her.&amp;nbsp; The song is about the moments before someone dies, about standing on the edge of glory.&amp;nbsp; Then there's "Born this Way," which of course takes on the theme of self-acceptance and is sort of an anthem for the LGBT community.&amp;nbsp; "Americano" is about the repeal of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8" target="_blank"&gt;Proposition 8&lt;/a&gt; in California, which prohibited same-sex marriage.&amp;nbsp; "Applause" is about being a celebrity and being appreciated for what Lady Gaga does as an entertainer.&amp;nbsp; These topics aren't found in your typical pop songs.&amp;nbsp; They're meant to be thoughtful and are maybe marketed in pop packaging, but it's really less so than you would think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"But serious music?&amp;nbsp; It's pop!" you might say.&amp;nbsp; Sure, her first album is more pop than her second or third, but again, look at The Beatles.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Please Please Me&lt;/i&gt; versus &lt;i&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/i&gt;?&amp;nbsp; The material changed a lot, as it does with Lady Gaga, who is an incredibly talented singer and songwriter.&amp;nbsp; Have you ever seen her belt out a tune playing the piano?&amp;nbsp; My personal favorite is "The Edge of Glory" (watch the video below for what I mean), which, by the way, Clarence Clemons from The E Street Band played saxophone on.&amp;nbsp; Not to mention, Brian May (yes, &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; Brian May from Queen) played the guitar on "Yoü and I" and even performed it live with Lady Gaga at the MTV Music Video Awards.&amp;nbsp; Sure, it's dance music and might be played on top 40 radio, but if you listen closely, you'll hear the inspiration from other music forms.&amp;nbsp; Not to mention her music videos are littered with references to rock &amp;amp; roll -- the lightning bolt on her face in "Just Dance" is homage to Ziggy Stardust, the prison scene in "Telephone" is reminiscent of Elvis Presley's "Jailhouse Rock," the dance sequence in "Bad Romance" has elements of Michael Jackson's "Thriller" (ok, MJ might be the King of Pop, but he came from Motown, which is closely related to rock music anyway...but this deserves its own essay).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nIrEdLXOapY" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the use of technology, I don't know how relevant this still is compared to the late 1960s, but I'm also not an expert of music technology today.&amp;nbsp; So I'm not going to claim any sort of expertise in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the authentic image is one that Gaga does well.&amp;nbsp; Watch her HBO special when she played at Madison Square Garden.&amp;nbsp; She might be playing up being the humble New Yorker making it big and being "weird" for the sake of her celebrity image.&amp;nbsp; However, reading interviews with her, she comes across as being genuine.&amp;nbsp; It's not just the interviews, but also her entire social media presence.&amp;nbsp; Thanks to social media, her fans have insight into what she's doing, what she thinks, and it's like following a friend on Twitter or Facebook.&amp;nbsp; She even has her own social media platform, &lt;a href="http://littlemonsters.com/"&gt;LittleMonsters.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id="goog_1896364913"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="goog_1896364914"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, where she can directly connect to her fans and vice versa.&amp;nbsp; She brings fans up on stage during live shows and then meets with them later backstage.&amp;nbsp; It reminds me of what Bruce Springsteen or Green Day do at their own shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when people raise their eyebrows and wonder why I love Lady Gaga and want to be down in the Monster Pit, it's actually not that far off from the other types of music I like.&amp;nbsp; It's a little more danceable and more gay-friendly, but it's still rock &amp;amp; roll to me.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/235161135780946763/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=235161135780946763&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/235161135780946763'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/235161135780946763'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2014/02/lady-gaga-is-totally-rock-roll.html' title='Lady Gaga is totally rock &amp;

Remember 1994?</title><content type='html'>Well, it's been quite awhile (again) since I've written, but I constantly think to myself, "Ooh, that'd make a good blog entry."&amp;nbsp; And then I just never get around to it.&amp;nbsp; For example, I've been wanting to write about Pharrell Williams' &lt;a href="http://24hoursofhappy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;24-hour music video&lt;/a&gt;, "Happy."&amp;nbsp; Yes, you read that correctly, a 24-hour music video, which is probably only possible thanks to the internet.&amp;nbsp; No, I haven't watched all 24 hours of it.&amp;nbsp; Considering that I'm all about music videos and the internet and I wrote my master's thesis about the topic, this is really up my alley.&amp;nbsp; However, I will have to put that aside for another day because I wanted to talk about the fact that it's 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's so special about 2014?&amp;nbsp; Well, it's not so much 2014 that's special, but pretty much one of my first thoughts in the new year was, "Holy crap, 1994 was 20 years ago."&amp;nbsp; For me, I think 1994 is the year that I became pop culturally aware.&amp;nbsp; Having two older sisters, I had always just sort of absorbed what they liked, but I began to branch out on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1994, these were the things that were relevant for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green Day's &lt;i&gt;Dookie&lt;/i&gt;, The Offspring's &lt;i&gt;Smash&lt;/i&gt;, and Weezer's &lt;i&gt;The Blue Album&lt;/i&gt; were all released.&amp;nbsp; I remember stealing &lt;i&gt;Dookie&lt;/i&gt; from my oldest sister's CD collection to listen to it because everyone was talking about it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Woodstock took place in Saugerties, New York.&amp;nbsp; I watched Green Day's performance and thought it was totally cool, especially when they started slinging mud back at everyone (If you want to just watch Billie Joe throwing mud at everyone, it starts around the 27:45 mark):&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8IH77GPpjvU" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rumor had it that the remaining Beatles would get back together, which they did a year later with "Free as a Bird" and "Real Love" in conjunction with The Beatles Anthology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the movies,&lt;i&gt; Forrest Gump&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Lion King&lt;/i&gt; were released.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The TV show &lt;i&gt;Friends&lt;/i&gt; started.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kurt Cobain died.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Winter Olympics took place and introduced me to Lillehammer, Norway.&amp;nbsp; Oh yeah, and there was that whole Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan shenanigans. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Incredibly, I still listen to those albums, remember Woodstock and wish I had been old enough to have gone, and was so incredibly excited about the Beatles possibly getting back together.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Forrest Gump &lt;/i&gt;made me more interested in post World War II American history and I absolutely loved the soundtrack, which includes must-know musicians and groups like Bob Dylan, Jefferson Airplane, and The Byrds.&amp;nbsp; I hadn't been all too familiar with them before, but the soundtrack piqued my curiosity.&amp;nbsp; With the start of &lt;i&gt;Friends&lt;/i&gt;, it was the start of being sucked into Must See TV on Thursday night.&amp;nbsp; It's surprising that my parents let me watch the show, considering I had never been allowed to watch &lt;i&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; When I look at &lt;i&gt;Friends&lt;/i&gt; now, I still see the appeal, but don't really particularly enjoy re-watching it.&amp;nbsp; And of course, when Kurt Cobain died, I remember some classmates coming in to school being devastated.&amp;nbsp; Having never been a huge Nirvana fan myself, it didn't affect me like it did others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if 1994 is still too much in the recent past to actually reflect upon it accurately.&amp;nbsp; Will I care in another 20 years when &lt;i&gt;Dookie&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Smash&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Blue Album&lt;/i&gt; came out?&amp;nbsp; Thinking about things on a slightly longer time scale, The Beatles first came to the United States in 1964 and appeared on the Ed Sullivan show on February 9.&amp;nbsp; Rock historians constantly talk about this seminal moment and because it's the 50-year anniversary, I'm sure there will be plenty of discussions surrounding its impact.&amp;nbsp; I don't think anything I've mentioned here will be of the same caliber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the new year's party this year, I turned to my husband and mentioned that I couldn't believe that these things were 20 years old.&amp;nbsp; He just looked at me and said I'm crazy that I think about these things.&amp;nbsp; But in all honesty, I just wonder what will be considered "of historical value" in another 30 years, and I'm particularly interested to see what 2014 will bring in memorable pop culture moments.&amp;nbsp; (Hopefully nothing like last year's twerking nonsense thanks to Miley Cyrus.) </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/2408197750977018300/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=2408197750977018300&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2408197750977018300'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2408197750977018300'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2014/01/happy-2014-remember-1994.html' title='Happy 2014!

Last year for Christmas, I got a fairly large present.&amp;nbsp; When it was wrapped up, I thought it was a Wii and got really excited.&amp;nbsp; It turned out to be a sewing machine.&amp;nbsp; "A sewing machine?" you ask.&amp;nbsp; Yes.&amp;nbsp; I had been saying for awhile that I wanted to learn how to sew to be self-sufficient.&amp;nbsp; Not only that, I have often gone into stores, found something I like and one of the following things happened:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fit sucked but looked nice on a hanger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't like the material but I like the cut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I liked something and it fit, but it was too expensive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I liked something but the quality was crap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I found something secondhand that was just too big.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;....you get the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sewing seems to be one of those things that our grandmothers had learned out of necessity, but our mothers scorned it when they burned their bras and demanded gender equality.&amp;nbsp; Why stay at home and learn to sew when there's a whole world out there to conquer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in this day and age, the choice to sew is much like any other choice a woman makes.&amp;nbsp; It's the freedom to choose what to do, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a secondhand dress in Berlin back in February in anticipation of learning how to sew.&amp;nbsp; On me, it looked like a tent since it was about 5 sizes too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iqhT-_gVDH0/Uf5a3cXoHmI/AAAAAAAAAy4/sGHjU-XFTik/s1600/IMG_2255.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iqhT-_gVDH0/Uf5a3cXoHmI/AAAAAAAAAy4/sGHjU-XFTik/s1600/IMG_2255.JPG" height="320" width="213" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If you look, it also had these hideous ruffles at the neckline and the sleeves were a bit poofy and again, just too big.&amp;nbsp; You can't see it in the picture, but there was also some material to tie into a bow or something.&amp;nbsp; All in all, not exactly a perfect dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I didn't know how to sew yet, I thought the dress had potential.&amp;nbsp; Maybe take the sleeves off or turn them into cap sleeves.&amp;nbsp; Shorten the hemline.&amp;nbsp; Bring it in to my own size.&amp;nbsp; How hard could it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered a sewing shop around the corner from where I live and I had three friends with sewing machines who also wanted to learn.&amp;nbsp; Who would've thought this was a thing?&amp;nbsp; I asked the shop owner if she would give us a private workshop and teach us how to sew, so we spent a Sunday afternoon learning by doing.&amp;nbsp; We picked out materials in the store and sewed it together to make a top.&amp;nbsp; It was pretty cool being able to create something unique from a bolt of fabric.&amp;nbsp; Although I was super psyched about making my own shirt, the shop owner had helped me &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I basically learned how to thread the sewing machine, the different parts of it, different tools needed when sewing, and the basics.&amp;nbsp; And I picked up some new German words on the way: &lt;i&gt;Oberfadenspannung &lt;/i&gt;(needle thread tension), &lt;i&gt;Stichmusterwahlknopf &lt;/i&gt;(the knob where you choose your stitching pattern).&amp;nbsp; Oh, Deutsch!&amp;nbsp; I also discovered sewing in a straight line is way harder than you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next project was to make a dinosaur-patterned tank top.&amp;nbsp; I had seen the material in the store and thought it was pretty fun, even if it was geared towards children.&amp;nbsp; I looked online how to make a pattern, vaguely understood it, and made my own pattern from a tank top I like.&amp;nbsp; It took me awhile and sure, the different lines where the fabric comes together didn't quite match up, but, success!&amp;nbsp; I started learning how to sew in a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided I should try making that secondhand Berlin dress smaller.&amp;nbsp; I tried following &lt;a href="http://jezebel.com/5815251/how-to-alter-a-thrift-store-dress" target="_blank"&gt;a tutorial on Jezebel&lt;/a&gt;, but didn't have the patience to read through the whole thing while sewing.&amp;nbsp; I basically just started pinning the dress here and there and had way too much ripping out the ruffles.&amp;nbsp; (Seriously, taking out material is a great way to let frustration out and is almost as satisfying as hitting the gym.&amp;nbsp; "Take that, you stupid ruffle!")&amp;nbsp; I kept being afraid I would screw up, but hey, the dress had only cost me 2.50€.&amp;nbsp; It took a few tries, but this is what the end product looks like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5ZQsX_iEwbo/Uf5gpw_yI7I/AAAAAAAAAzI/-KNMtaMKaSQ/s1600/Photo+on+8-4-13+at+3.09+PM.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5ZQsX_iEwbo/Uf5gpw_yI7I/AAAAAAAAAzI/-KNMtaMKaSQ/s1600/Photo+on+8-4-13+at+3.09+PM.jpg" height="213" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not quite perfect and there's still room for improvement, but I'm getting better at sewing in a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny thing about learning how to sew is that I've discovered how calming it can be.&amp;nbsp; I sit there and concentrate so that I actually can block out anything else that I would normally think about.&amp;nbsp; It might seem like an old-fashioned thing to do, but at the same time, it has a soothing effect that helps with all the modern-day stress.&amp;nbsp; I'm not nearly at a point where I am confident enough and could sew anything for anyone, but it's definitely something I think I will continue to do, if not to actually create cool things, but to just sort of relax a little bit and feel like I'm being self-sufficient.&amp;nbsp;

As someone who goes to concerts rather frequently, I have my own list of annoying habits.&amp;nbsp; In addition to all the points mentioned in the RS article, here is my own list of annoying concert-going habits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Taking pictures the entire freaking show.&amp;nbsp; With a flash.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mFZ7YL50NQk/UbRmRfaS2fI/AAAAAAAAAxI/jz4P0qEXQCE/s1600/IMG_9178.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mFZ7YL50NQk/UbRmRfaS2fI/AAAAAAAAAxI/jz4P0qEXQCE/s1600/IMG_9178.JPG" height="200" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;At the OK Go show, January 2010.&lt;br /&gt;Not possible with a flash.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I totally agree with this first point from the RS article. Seriously, stop taking pictures the entire time and then posting them to Facebook or Twitter.&amp;nbsp; Go ahead, take a few pictures, but the effort that you put in to taking the picture, writing a caption, and tagging stuff is making you miss the point of being at a show.&amp;nbsp; Your big ass smartphone/tablet/camera screen is also really, really distracting.&amp;nbsp; And you know how you have the flash turned on?&amp;nbsp; Basic rule of photography: you're too far away for it to make a difference.&amp;nbsp; So turn the flash off because you're just going to end up with crappy pictures anyway.&amp;nbsp; Namely, you're just taking pictures of the guy's head in front of you.&amp;nbsp; Luckily, I haven't yet gone to a show where someone has their iPad out to take pictures.&amp;nbsp; However, if that did happen, that person probably deserves to get punched or thrown into the mosh pit with their iPad.&amp;nbsp; Note to anyone reading this who actually takes pictures with your tablet at a show: everyone thinks you're a jerk.&amp;nbsp; And you are because your iPad is distracting and blocking everyone's view.&amp;nbsp; Not to mention you look ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Looking at your smartphone the whole concert.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are you at a concert if you're going to just be texting or looking at Facebook?&amp;nbsp; Some girls in front of me at The Killers went together, but all of them were looking at Facebook the whole. freaking. time.&amp;nbsp; They didn't even talk to each other between Louis XIV and The Killers.&amp;nbsp; Do your texting or Facebooking between bands.&amp;nbsp; But when a band is on the stage, please stop.&amp;nbsp; And if you're bored and the music is not your thing, just leave because you'll do everyone else a favor.&amp;nbsp; Also if the opening band is not your thing, there are other people around you who are trying to enjoy the music.&amp;nbsp; So go get a drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Cuddling/making out with your significant other when the music doesn't really call for it.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw Dropkick Murphys earlier this year and was way up front against the stage barrier.&amp;nbsp; It should be said that a DKM show is on the rowdy side and everyone just surges forward, crushing everyone in front.&amp;nbsp; There was a couple in front of me making out the entire two hour set.&amp;nbsp; Yes, at a Dropkick Murphys show.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, if you want to get your freak on, get it on somewhere else where you're not going to have other concertgoers crushed up against you who are trying to mosh or jump around or whatever.&amp;nbsp; Or at least go to the back.&amp;nbsp; This girl and her boyfriend were making out and her back was to the stage the entire night.&amp;nbsp; Every time I would get shoved up against them, she would put her hands out to try to prevent everyone pushing up against them.&amp;nbsp; She only wound up scratching my eyes out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But generally, nobody wants to see you fondling your girlfriend's ass or with your hand down your boyfriend's pants.&amp;nbsp; Now, if the show were for Celine Dion or Michael Bublé, cuddling would be more appropriate. But it's sort of weird and out of place at a punk show like DKM or Rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; Pulling hair in the mosh pit or otherwise. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I've actually experienced this.&amp;nbsp; The mosh pit is a place of mostly no rules -- punching, kicking, shoving is all allowed.&amp;nbsp; But &lt;i&gt;pulling hair&lt;/i&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Really?&amp;nbsp; I sometimes end up in the pit not on my own free will, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't pull my hair.&amp;nbsp; I get it, I'll probably get shoved or punched or kicked, but pulling hair requires a sort of motor skill where you're actually targeting something/someone.&amp;nbsp; So, stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; Kids and their parents with general admission tickets all the way up front against the stage where they will most likely get crushed even though there's seats available.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Whew, that was a long one.)&amp;nbsp; I'm all for bringing kids to shows if they like the band.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I encourage it.&amp;nbsp; Going to concerts is awesome.&amp;nbsp; But it's not so great when the parents think it'd be a good idea to go up front against the stage at a show that's quite clearly going to get rowdy.&amp;nbsp; Usually being in the back is a little better because it's not as brutal as up front.&amp;nbsp; Parents should seriously consider this point because if there are seats available (like in a stadium show or even if there is open seating on the side or in the back), they'll be much happier, their kid will be able to see, and they won't get crushed against the crowd.&amp;nbsp; Basically, everyone wins: no stress for the parents, the kid can say they went to the show, and nobody in the crowd is annoyed that there's a 10-year-old with their parents yelling at everyone uselessly to stop pushing forward.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, this is dependent on the type of show -- Bruce Springsteen all the way up front?&amp;nbsp; Sure, go for it.&amp;nbsp; The Boss might even bring your kid on stage.&amp;nbsp; Green Day?&amp;nbsp; Not so much because people might actually mosh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6.&amp;nbsp; Getting annoyed that other people are reasonably cheering, screaming, whistling, or dancing.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is a thing here in Germany, but I've experienced this quite a bit.&amp;nbsp; For example, I was at Lady Gaga stadium concert and my friends and I were cheering between songs as people normally do.&amp;nbsp; We were also dancing during the songs (we also had general admission tickets, so it wasn't as if we were dancing and blocking other people's views).&amp;nbsp; Some moms and their teenagers were throwing us dirty looks and were loudly complaining about us.&amp;nbsp; We weren't the only ones cheering; in fact, they were the only ones &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; cheering/screaming/whistling/dancing (come on, it's Lady Gaga).&amp;nbsp; And we were next to the stage.&amp;nbsp; If you're going to get annoyed by this sort of behavior and the behavior is within reason, maybe going to a concert really isn't your type of thing.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7.&amp;nbsp; Being on a call in the middle of a set, so you have to scream into your phone.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you call and just let your friend listen because they know you're at a concert for xyz, that's cool.&amp;nbsp; Spread the love, as long as your smartphone isn't above your head and distracting me.&amp;nbsp; But being on a call in the middle of a set and screaming into your phone, "I'm a concert....What?&amp;nbsp; I can't hear you...I'm AT A CONCERT!" is not helping anyone out.&amp;nbsp; You or the person on the phone or everyone else.&amp;nbsp; It's kind of like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m703ix7rc91rozk7ho1_250.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m703ix7rc91rozk7ho1_250.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;But worse because it's not 1955, you're not backstage, and it's not &lt;i&gt;Back to the Future.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8.&amp;nbsp; Pretending you have friends up front so they let you through.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if you're going to be pushing your way up front and pissing everyone else off to begin with, just do it without the pretext of looking for friends.&amp;nbsp; It's already douche-y enough to shove your way through, but pretending you have friends so people are nice to you is just not cool.&amp;nbsp; As the RS article pointed out, those people up front got there early and claimed their space.&amp;nbsp; So deal with being elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.&amp;nbsp; Sitting on someone's shoulders so nobody behind you can see.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm short, especially here in Germany.&amp;nbsp; But I deal with it by moving over to the side closer to the stage or by positioning myself to where I might be able to see over someone's shoulder.&amp;nbsp; It's always a pain when some chick is sitting on her boyfriend's shoulders.&amp;nbsp; Everyone behind them can't see.&amp;nbsp; Sure, the argument is that you're at a show to hear the music, but seeing is also part of the experience.&amp;nbsp; So don't block everyone else's view just because you can't see anything.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, I think this is more annoying than people crowd-surfing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10.&amp;nbsp; Loudly talking about the opening band and how they suck.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not every opening band is great or even good.&amp;nbsp; And yes, the majority of people are not at a show for the opening band.&amp;nbsp; But if you're going complain about them where everyone around you is clearly trying to listen to them, please stop talking.&amp;nbsp; If you think they're so crappy, go get a drink or some fresh air.&amp;nbsp; I personally like listening to opening bands because I've discovered quite a few bands that way.&amp;nbsp; Not only that, the opening band is trying and they're putting their music out there.&amp;nbsp; I can't imagine that it's easy to put out your own music that means so much to you and having complete strangers judge both you and your music.&amp;nbsp; Not only that, the crowd is probably already against you because they're not there to see you.&amp;nbsp; So as a concertgoer, be at least polite because it'll make a more pleasant experience for everyone.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/9105710421218317133/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=9105710421218317133&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/9105710421218317133'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/9105710421218317133'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2013/06/seriously-annoying-concert-going-habits.html' title='Seriously Annoying Concert-Going Habits'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mFZ7YL50NQk/UbRmRfaS2fI/AAAAAAAAAxI/jz4P0qEXQCE/s72-c/IMG_9178.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-2960917438716644044</id><published>2013-05-18T17:28:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-06-09T15:25:23.552+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TV'/><title type='text'>Some thoughts on How I Met Your Mother</title><content type='html'>If you read my last blog post, you'll know that I don't watch TV the same day or week where something premieres.&amp;nbsp; The season 8 finale of &lt;i&gt;How I Met Your Mother &lt;/i&gt;was on TV five days ago, but I've only managed to watch it now.&amp;nbsp; As much as the show seems to drag on endlessly for some viewers, I have to say that I felt the season 8 finale, "Something New," was incredibly rewarding for someone who's followed the show longer.&amp;nbsp; OK, I'll admit I was late coming to it and only started watching regularly in its third season, but this particular episode is a great example of why I keep coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm generally not a huge TV person and there are only a few shows I've ever followed regularly.&amp;nbsp; Sitcoms are an especially interesting genre because I don't really have much patience to follow a show.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Friends&lt;/i&gt; got old after the sixth season, as did &lt;i&gt;Scrubs&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Will &amp;amp; Grace&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I think &lt;i&gt;Frasier&lt;/i&gt; was pretty good, but I was in middle and high school at the time, so probably didn't get the humor.&amp;nbsp; I've watched episodes of &lt;i&gt;30 Rock&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/i&gt;, both of which I find absolutely hilarious, but I haven't seen every single episode, nor do I really plan on it.&amp;nbsp; The sitcom is a very episodic format, where things happen in one episode and it's done.&amp;nbsp; The overarching story exists, but is usually something that you can sum up in a few sentences.&amp;nbsp; I usually don't end up caring about characters in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, that's not true with &lt;i&gt;HIMYM&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Each character has his or her strengths and stories and although Ted is the main character, we care about what happens to Marshall, Lily, Robin, and Barney as well.&amp;nbsp; The show is not just about the funny moments, but also the ones that make you think or the ones that make you cry.&amp;nbsp; Sure, the show's title &lt;i&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/i&gt; is essentially what the show is about and that's what I always argue with people who say, "I want to know who the mother is already!"&amp;nbsp; It's not the who, it's the how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In "Something New," there are moments that just really bring back story lines and jokes from previous episodes.&amp;nbsp; My favorite is when Lily asks, "Where's the poop?"&amp;nbsp; In the episode where this line first appears (Season 6, "Unfinished"), the question, "Where's the poop?" is meant to get Robin to tell Lily about her drunk dialing Don after he's moved to Chicago.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, here in season 8 it's about getting Ted to tell Lily about how he hasn't gotten over Robin.&amp;nbsp; The whole Robin-Ted story line has been running since the show began and I like how it continues to appear.&amp;nbsp; We as the audience know that Robin isn't the mother, but it's part of the journey to get us to the mother.&amp;nbsp; Relationships are always complicated and the Robin-Ted story reflects that.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time the episode comes to an end, we finally see the mother.&amp;nbsp; She has the yellow umbrella that we have gotten to associate with her and the bass that she plays in the Robin and Barney's wedding band.&amp;nbsp; And she's buying a train ticket to Farhampton where we saw Ted at the beginning of season 8 talking to Klaus about Lebenslangerschickshalschatz (not a real German word, but kind of awesome because it's all real German words stuck together).&amp;nbsp; We know that Ted is so incredibly close to meeting the girl he'll marry, but for him, he feels desolate, hopeless, and abandoned.&amp;nbsp; The other plot lines (Robin &amp;amp; Barney's future together, if Lily &amp;amp; Marshall go to Rome) are just as important, but for the moment, we can finally savor having a face to the titular character. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/2960917438716644044/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=2960917438716644044&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2960917438716644044'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2960917438716644044'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2013/05/why-i-like-watching-how-i-met-your.html' title='Some thoughts on How I Met Your Mother'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-7003905730091102859</id><published>2013-05-11T15:28:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2013-06-09T15:25:47.045+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='internet'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='social media'/><title type='text'>How Social Media is Ruining TV (for me)</title><content type='html'>I don't consider myself a big TV person, but I am a loyal fan of two current shows: &lt;i&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I keep up-to-date with them, as well, meaning, I am on the current season for both shows.&amp;nbsp; Thank God for the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, even though the internet allows me to watch these shows, I can't watch them on Monday (for &lt;i&gt;HIMYM&lt;/i&gt;) or Sunday (for &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;nbsp; In order to avoid finding out anything that happened, I practically have to avoid all social media the day after new episodes air.&amp;nbsp; I have too many friends that watch them and will write something about it.&amp;nbsp; Twitter is the worst, especially when it comes to &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt;/AMC social media team and think they are doing a fantastic job of hyping and getting the show discussed.&amp;nbsp; But I know that tomorrow morning, about 3/4 of my Twitter feed will be filled with reactions to &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt; that the show retweeted.&amp;nbsp; A good example is when the current sixth season started -- I knew before I watched the episode that (SPOILER ALERT!) Don was back to his womanizing ways and sleeping with his neighbor.&amp;nbsp; As a result, the suspense from the fifth season's cliffhanger was sort of anticlimactic.&amp;nbsp; Of course, I still watched the episode, but my reaction was sort of, "OK, I know that already."&amp;nbsp; Here's some examples of what I don't really want to see at all, even though I would click on it after watching the episode (this past week was surprisingly not too bad):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

tweeted about an &lt;a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/theres-a-new-app-that-prevents-you-from-having-tv,97499/?utm_source=Twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=standard-post:headline:default" target="_blank"&gt;add-on&lt;/a&gt; which essentially makes social media ruining your TV viewing habits your own fault.&amp;nbsp; It was as if they read my mind or something:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Because I like reading about the non-spoiler stuff, like production or what have you.&amp;nbsp; I'll give the add-on a whirl and see if I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a related social media note, is Facebook asking anyone else for more information?&amp;nbsp; I constantly get this screen when I log in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vSc2A6TX2t0/UY5Dl5pXa2I/AAAAAAAAAwU/zoNFiXQqcbU/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-10+at+10.20.04+AM.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

Try to make the whole social media experience more personalized, "more social."&amp;nbsp; But there's quite obviously a reason why I &lt;i&gt;haven't&lt;/i&gt; shared 40% of my information nor updated anything relevant.&amp;nbsp; So Facebook, please, stop asking me for this information.&amp;nbsp; At least add an option to not see this screen again because it's just annoying.&amp;nbsp; I also find it slightly irritating that I can't delete my college information.&amp;nbsp; This isn't really relevant to have on my Facebook profile anymore; it was useful when Facebook was only open to college students.&amp;nbsp; Has anyone else figured out how to get rid of that information?&amp;nbsp; I've tried with absolutely no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now I officially feel like I'm &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; going retro.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/7003905730091102859/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=7003905730091102859&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7003905730091102859'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7003905730091102859'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2013/05/how-social-media-is-ruining-tv-for-me.html' title='How Social Media is Ruining TV (for me)'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ckwkAwpncGA/UY5FoVIbZ3I/AAAAAAAAAwg/FhNUroAE8g4/s72-c/Screen+Shot+2013-05-07+at+9.24.24+PM.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-7822722485271165968</id><published>2012-04-29T13:52:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2012-04-29T13:53:47.548+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='movies'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='films'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='germany'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='cinema'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='3D'/><title type='text'>Going to the Movies in Germany</title><content type='html'>On Friday night, I went to go see &lt;i&gt;The Avengers&lt;/i&gt; because it was surprisingly released here in Germany a few days earlier than in the U.S.&amp;nbsp; I had only had the choice of watching it in 3D in English or 3D dubbed in German.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, I didn't choose to watch it dubbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xuR3wSKeNOc" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't really care for 3D movies.&amp;nbsp; I've seen only 3 that I can think of: Tim Burton's &lt;i&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Avatar&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Avengers&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Here in Germany, 3D movies are more expensive to see like everywhere else.&amp;nbsp; And like everywhere else, you also have to pay for the glasses.&amp;nbsp; My boyfriend and I used a Groupon deal, and we still had to pay 9€.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, here in Germany if a movie is over 2 hours long, it's considered "Überlänge," or excessive length (basically, a long movie).&amp;nbsp; And that means you'll add on another Euro to the movie price.&amp;nbsp; So for a 3D movie, you're already paying 2-4€ extra because it's in 3D, plus another 2€ for the glasses, and then if it's over 2 hours long, add on another 1€.&amp;nbsp; Basically, to see a movie in 3D, you're paying an extra 7€, which is around the price of a 2D ticket on discounted days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here in Germany, movies that are two hours long are broken up in the middle of the movie and there's a break.&amp;nbsp; I'm not kidding.&amp;nbsp; It's like an intermission right at the climax that isn't meant to be there.&amp;nbsp; Thankfully with the transition to digital projections, the projectionist hopefully tries to pick a less climactic scene to insert the break (around the 90 minute mark), whereas with analog, the break came at the end of the first film roll.&amp;nbsp; It's slightly better, but not by much.&amp;nbsp; I ask myself, why the heck am I paying an extra 1€ for the theater to give me a break?&amp;nbsp; I'll pay them the extra 1€ to keep the movie going and &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; have a break because it ruins the movie's pacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/i&gt; a few weeks ago, the break seemed to make sense and was taken right before Katniss goes into the arena.&amp;nbsp; OK, great, it made sense.&amp;nbsp; But the projectionist somehow messed up the projection's settings in the second half and the colors were completely desaturated.&amp;nbsp; I don't think they noticed because they didn't change it.&amp;nbsp; It annoyed me completely because everything was just too cold, there was way too much blue in the picture.&amp;nbsp; You might argue, "But in the arena, maybe that'd be better because it's not supposed to be a warm, fuzzy place, right?"&amp;nbsp; NO.&amp;nbsp; I want to see the movie the way it was intended.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I could've gotten up and said to the manager that the colors were wrong, but then I would've missed out on whatever happened.&amp;nbsp; So either I miss what happens completely, or I deal with crappy colors.&amp;nbsp; It made me annoyed that I paid for a movie and the projectionist is so incompetent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings me to last night at &lt;i&gt;The Avengers&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; After the break, the projectionist couldn't figure out how to turn the picture on.&amp;nbsp; So there we were, &lt;i&gt;listening &lt;/i&gt;to everything that was happening, but not &lt;i&gt;seeing&lt;/i&gt; it.&amp;nbsp; It took the projectionist a good 5 to 10 minutes to realize it.&amp;nbsp; Then they took an extra 10 minutes to figure it out while we sat there looking at a white light on the screen.&amp;nbsp; All seemed to work well afterward, and then the picture cut out again.&amp;nbsp; The projectionist wound up figuring it out and rewound it to the point where it had cut out, but seriously, way to ruin the pacing of the movie and the element of surprise.&amp;nbsp; I don't understand why I'm paying so much money for a movie when the theater can't do its job and show it right, including the break.&amp;nbsp; People can choose if they want to go to the toilet or not, or buy more snacks or not.&amp;nbsp; Why the heck should everyone else have to take a break?&amp;nbsp; I don't want to have to pay so much money to ruin a good movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I miss seeing movies with Americans.&amp;nbsp; Americans react to movies.&amp;nbsp; For example, when I went to see &lt;i&gt;Bridesmaids&lt;/i&gt;, a lady next to me said outloud, "Oh no, she di'nt!" during a particularly gruesome scene.&amp;nbsp; During &lt;i&gt;X-Men First Class&lt;/i&gt;, the guy behind me commented, "Daaaaaaay-mmmnnn," during a climactic and visually impressive scene.&amp;nbsp; And when I went to see one of the Harry Potter movies at midnight, people cheered and clapped and hooted. None of this ever happens while watching a movie in Germany.&amp;nbsp; People barely laugh aloud during comedies.&amp;nbsp; They might smirk or quietly giggle to themselves at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Daaaaaaay-mmmnnn!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ONK3kLT0258" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may think it's annoying when people react to the movie.&amp;nbsp; I personally have no problem with it as long as it a reaction to what's happening and not some idiot making comments about which characters from the book are on screen (that happened during &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/i&gt;. The guy was like, "Oh!&amp;nbsp; That's Foxface!"&amp;nbsp; Thanks, I knew that, shut up).&amp;nbsp; It's part of the experience seeing a movie in the theater with other people, even if you don't know them.&amp;nbsp; When I saw a Harry Potter movie here on opening day, I cheered ("YAAAY!") when the Warner Bros. logo and the title appeared, and someone &lt;i&gt;actually shushed me&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There wasn't even anything happening on screen.&amp;nbsp; And can I stress it again: it was opening day of a Harry Potter movie.&amp;nbsp; Talk about lame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, whenever I am home in the United States, I go to the movies so that I can get the lovely reactions from the fellow moviegoers.&amp;nbsp; Not to mention eating buttered popcorn.&amp;nbsp; I miss that too.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/7822722485271165968/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=7822722485271165968&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7822722485271165968'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7822722485271165968'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2012/04/going-to-movies-in-germany.html' title='Going to the Movies in Germany'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://img.youtube.com/vi/xuR3wSKeNOc/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-1547202225684970223</id><published>2012-03-11T18:17:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2012-03-11T19:05:54.391+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TV'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='germany'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shows'/><title type='text'>Watching American TV in Germany</title><content type='html'>A few weeks ago, &lt;a href="http://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; posted &lt;a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones" target="_blank"&gt;a comic&lt;/a&gt; about streaming Game of Thrones (due to copyright, I can't actually post it on my blog, so go look at it before you read the rest of this).&amp;nbsp; The essence of the comic is that there is a dilemma to watching shows legally: watch it on Netflix or download it on iTunes, purchase it through Amazon, stream it on Hulu or the HBO site, or just download it illegally.&amp;nbsp; The dilemma is when the show is unavailable on legal sources like Netflix, iTunes, Amazon, and Hulu, and HBO wants you to have a whole subscription in order to watch it.&amp;nbsp; At that point, you can either wait until Hulu/Netflix/other services has it, or you can download it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living outside the United States poses a similar problem.&amp;nbsp; I myself prefer to choose legal means to consume media and pay for everything because I think that the people involved with the media production deserve to get the money (though yes, I do realize that they only get pennies and it's the executives and other people not actually involved in production that get the biggest portion).&amp;nbsp; However, it's problematic when shows are a season behind here in Germany because the shows need to be dubbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's my biggest problem.&amp;nbsp; I would love to have a service like Netflix here, but the majority of services don't offer the choice between watching something in the original version and the dubbed version.&amp;nbsp; It's so stupid because it is so easy to have different files with different audio tracks -- look at DVDs!&amp;nbsp; I also can't buy/rent/stream things through the American Amazon or iTunes because my IP address is obviously from Germany.&amp;nbsp; I could pay for an American proxy server, sure, but I'm pretty sure there could be some legal hangups there just as much as downloading.&amp;nbsp; So even if I want to watch something legally, I might have to watch it dubbed if I watch it online.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, I have to wait until the DVD comes out and that takes even longer than in the U.S.&amp;nbsp; DVDs can come out possibly two seasons after it airs in the U.S.&amp;nbsp; Can you imagine trying to not hear about how &lt;i&gt;Lost&lt;/i&gt; ended while waiting for the DVDs?&amp;nbsp; It was a near impossible task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here in Germany, it's not even just limited to watching TV shows.&amp;nbsp; I can't even watch videos on YouTube that have music in them, including official music videos from the artists.&amp;nbsp; (Trying to find Lady Gaga's video "Marry the Night" in its entirety was annoying.)&amp;nbsp; Thanks to GEMA, official music videos can't be streamed over YouTube because it would be too expensive to have to pay for every time the video is watched.&amp;nbsp; Even for big acts like Lady Gaga.&amp;nbsp; It just frustrates me that OFFICIAL VIDEOS are even blocked!&amp;nbsp; It's not like it's some schmuck that uploaded a poor copy of the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is it that in this day and age of interconnectivity we are still unable to figure out connections like this?&amp;nbsp; I guess part of it is the SOPA/PIPA/ACTA type bills that try to prosecute servers which have uploaded files.&amp;nbsp; Watching the debates of the SOPA/PIPA bills was simultaneously amusing and sad because none of the sponsors seem to really have an idea how the internet works.&amp;nbsp; But listening to them also just made me think that copyright laws are completely out of date.&amp;nbsp; They don't take into account that the world is more connected and that technology is changing the way we consume media.&amp;nbsp; Copyright laws had problems even back in the day of video tapes and cassettes and yet those are still the same laws with minimal change that are policy.&amp;nbsp; I think copyright law should be scrapped and rewritten anew and take into consideration that interconnectivity is inevitable.&amp;nbsp; Not only that, but companies are losing even more money because of these restrictions.&amp;nbsp; I would like to believe that people other than myself would pay for available services to watch shows in broadcast quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, two shows I watch regularly allow people abroad to watch them on their websites: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I don't know what exactly their deal is and why they are accessible, but I watch both shows on the sites directly and even sit through the advertisements.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes the ads are geared towards someone living in Germany, meaning, they're in German, but sometimes they're clearly ads for an American audience for products that don't exist here.&amp;nbsp; But that's ok.&amp;nbsp; Because they are available here NOT DUBBED or shortened or anything, I feel that my loyalty to the shows is even more so than with others who refuse access.&amp;nbsp; So kudos to Comedy Central and Viacom for allowing fans outside North America to watch these shows.&amp;nbsp; Everyone else should follow their example.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/1547202225684970223/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=1547202225684970223&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1547202225684970223'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1547202225684970223'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2012/03/watching-american-tv-in-germany.html' title='Watching American TV in Germany'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-7964997345441667847</id><published>2012-02-10T14:02:00.004+01:00</published><updated>2012-02-11T21:34:05.954+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music video'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ok go'/><title type='text'>Definitely Not Selling Out</title><content type='html'>Last weekend, OK Go released their eighth (I think) music video off their album &lt;i&gt;Of the Blue Colour of the Sky&lt;/i&gt; for the song "Needing/Getting."&amp;nbsp; It goes without saying that my anticipation for a new OK Go video is always high, but this video was different because if looked at really quickly, it looks like an ad.&amp;nbsp; Here's the video:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MejbOFk7H6c" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The car is a Chevy Sonic and the car company liked the video so much, they integrated it into a Super Bowl ad (which you can see &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/gp6PRIaD8qk" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; The ad is impressive, but not nearly as amazing as the video.&amp;nbsp; I really don't think I need to say anything about the video; since Sunday, there have been almost 10.8 million views.&amp;nbsp; Yes, you read that right.&amp;nbsp; I don't know what the numbers are for their other music videos off &lt;i&gt;Of the Blue Colour...&lt;/i&gt; or for "Here It Goes Again," but regardless, that's about 1.8 million views per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what got me thinking was how prominently the car and Chevy's logo are featured in the video.&amp;nbsp; You could almost argue it is an ad for the car itself.&amp;nbsp; My thought process went like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"But OK Go totally aren't sell-outs."&amp;nbsp; Pause.&amp;nbsp; "But what's the definition of a sell-out?&amp;nbsp; Isn't this the epitome of selling out?&amp;nbsp; They were in a Super Bowl ad!"&amp;nbsp; Pause.&amp;nbsp; "No, they're not sell-outs."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Wikipedia, "selling out" is "the compromising of (or the perception of compromising) integrity, morality, or principles in exchange for money or 'success' (however defined)."&amp;nbsp; Later, it details sell outs in music, citing merchandising and commercialization as characteristics.&amp;nbsp; Now, how is appearing in a Super Bowl ad, the mother of all commercialization, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; selling out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK Go left their major label, Capitol Records, so that they could endeavor in their own creative projects, namely, their own record label, Paracadute, and making music videos, uploading them online and not having to deal with the sticky problem of copyrights, embedding, etc.&amp;nbsp; The band has used corporate sponsorship/support for other music videos previously: Range Rover's Pulse of the City app for "Back from Kathmandu," State Farm for "This Too Shall Pass," Google Chrome for "All Is Not Lost."&amp;nbsp; But again, "Needing/Getting" appeared in a Super Bowl ad and the car is much more prominent than any of the logos in the previous videos (ok, for "All is Not Lost," the interactive version is only viewable using Chrome).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I don't think this is selling out at all is because Chevy did not approach the band and tell them to make a video using the Sonic.&amp;nbsp; The idea is the band's and in order to realize their creative ideas, they need corporate sponsorship.&amp;nbsp; I can't imagine the cost of producing the video, but hey, if Chevy is going to pay for it and the band gets to have an amazing video, why not?&amp;nbsp; The Wikipedia definition discusses the compromising of integrity, morality, or principles, and this is obviously not the case with OK Go.&amp;nbsp; If they need something, why not go to companies with deep pockets who are willing to put the money out for them?&amp;nbsp; Moreover, the band has had behind-the-scenes videos for their fans because the majority of people ask, "How did they do that?!"&amp;nbsp; I know I've said this before, but I've liked the band since they released their first album and have seen them grow in popularity.&amp;nbsp; Lots of people know them and that's ok.&amp;nbsp; But they make these videos for themselves and for their fans, hence why I think that "Needing/Getting" is still not selling out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think advertising is definitely changing and rather than there being pure commercials, meaning, television advertisements during TV shows, products are being more and more integrated with other visual forms.&amp;nbsp; What I mean is that commercials don't stand alone anymore; they can be seen online on YouTube.&amp;nbsp; However, it is not limited there because music videos are generally becoming commercials too.&amp;nbsp; Yes, they were always commercials for the music they sold, but check out the slew of videos now that include products (Lady Gaga's "Telephone," J. Lo ft. Pitbull's "On the Floor," LMFAO's "Sexy and I Know It," etc.)&amp;nbsp; The products in those videos feel less organic than the Chevy Sonic in the "Needing/Getting" video; the OK Go video would not work without a car, whereas the other videos could function without the product placement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to applaud Chevy for working with OK Go.&amp;nbsp; For me, seeing a company that wants to support artistic creativity through such advertising is more effective than a funny commerical (see: &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/VhkDdayA4iA" target="_blank"&gt;Honda's Super Bowl ad&lt;/a&gt; featuring Matthew Broderick and remaking &lt;i&gt;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; My reaction: Meh, ok...what car was it again?).&amp;nbsp; I am far more likely to watch the OK Go video repeatedly (and I have admittedly seen it at least four times already) than the Matthew Broderick ad.&amp;nbsp; And every time I watch the video, I will see the Chevy Sonic.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; is what I call effective advertising.&amp;nbsp; For OK Go, it's just another creative music video with the help of a big corporate company, but definitely not selling out.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/7964997345441667847/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=7964997345441667847&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7964997345441667847'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7964997345441667847'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2012/02/definitely-not-selling-out.html' title='Definitely Not Selling Out'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://img.youtube.com/vi/MejbOFk7H6c/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-1547660724582064045</id><published>2012-01-31T14:14:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2012-01-31T14:14:40.714+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gigs'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='concerts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='paul mccartney'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='shows'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='white stripes'/><title type='text'>Why Going to Concerts Can't Be Bad</title><content type='html'>Last week, I came across &lt;a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/dont-stay-home-the-importance-of-catching-the-musi,68138/" target="_blank"&gt;this excellent article&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.avclub.com/" target="_blank"&gt;AV Club&lt;/a&gt; about the "importance of catching the music while you can."&amp;nbsp; Writer Keith Phipps points out that it's not only the threat of&amp;nbsp; a musician's death that should send you to concerts, but also retirement, the musician's strength varies from year to year, and inspiration may just fade.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I couldn't agree more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;

My boyfriend and other friends always make jokes about it and can't understand why I spent about 230€ on tickets the last time I saw him two days in a row by myself.&amp;nbsp; But there's something magical about seeing an artist you particularly love and every performance is different.&amp;nbsp; I figured that he was in Cologne and nobody wanted to come with me (imagine that), so why not spend the 160€ on one ticket?&amp;nbsp; When else would I ever be able to spend that much money and be that close to one of my favorite musicians of all time?&amp;nbsp; I also went to the following night's performance but paid for the cheapest seat; the experience was different than sitting up front, but all the same, it was amazing.&amp;nbsp; I know that Paul McCartney will not live forever and seeing him is one of the few chances I ever get hearing a real Beatle playing Beatles songs.&amp;nbsp; For that reason, I also went to see Ringo Starr last year, even though I'm not a fan of his solo work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, I seem to have reached a point in my life where I realize how many acts I have not seen but wish I had, even though I don't see myself as particularly old, nor have I missed many shows.&amp;nbsp; One of my biggest regrets is not seeing George Harrison while he was still alive, even though I had been old enough to see him.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, I guess that's why I've been shelling out money to go see big-name acts; recently I went to see Eric Clapton with Steve Winwood, Bon Jovi, and in May, I will be seeing Bruce Springsteen.&amp;nbsp; I never considered myself huge fans of any of those artists, but seeing Clapton on the guitar was an unforgettable experience.&amp;nbsp; Regardless of his age, he can still let it rip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also gone to great lengths to get tickets to certain shows.&amp;nbsp; Two in particular come to mind: Weezer at Irving Plaza back in the summer of 2002 (I think) when Mikey Welsh was their bassist and the White Stripes' "secret" show also at Irving Plaza (changed to the Fillmore) back in 2007.&amp;nbsp; In the case of Weezer, their roadie/friend Karl Koch had posted on their website that the band had a surprise for fans that waited outside the MTV TRL studios that day.&amp;nbsp; (Yes, this was that long ago that TRL actually was important)&amp;nbsp; It turned out that people in the TRL studio audience got tickets (even though the majority there were 'NSync fans b/c the band was there via satellite or something); otherwise, there was an opportunity to win tickets at a store near Radio City Music Hall.&amp;nbsp; I wasn't in the audience and had to try my luck winning (which in the end, I miraculously did), but I also ran around Times Square trying to find people with tickets to buy off of, went to Irving Plaza to try to beg my way in, and everything else.&amp;nbsp; That was the first time I ever saw Weezer and what a great show it was.&amp;nbsp; However, it's not just the show I remember -- it is the craziness of running around New York City trying to convince someone to let me into the show and how much fun it was bonding with other Weezer fans.&amp;nbsp; I didn't keep in touch with them, but the camraderie on that day and the pure joy that music could bring will always stay in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jCQqRuTBoWI/TyfohtZCGTI/AAAAAAAAAXI/RJGOYnOszHw/s1600/576208032_1fce26e6ca.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right;

I had just graduated from college and didn't really want to buy tickets for their arena tour.&amp;nbsp; I knew they were playing Madison Square Garden, but I couldn't bear the thought of seeing the White Stripes for the first time in such a huge place.&amp;nbsp; Luckily, they announced a 'secret' show that I found out about reading the &lt;a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Brooklyn Vegan&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Tickets were to go on sale only at the box office at around 10 in the morning on a weekend or something like that.&amp;nbsp; I decided to take the first bus out from Jersey at around 5-ish and by the time I got downtown, the line went around the block to the Toys R Us on Union Square.&amp;nbsp; I had told a White-Stripes-crazy acquaintance about it and luckily, he had been in line much earlier than me because he lived in the city.&amp;nbsp; So I got in line with him and managed to get tickets.&amp;nbsp; The show was spectacular and we managed to get close to the front.&amp;nbsp; But again, it's not necessarily the show that I will remember, but the fact that it was the one time I saw one of my favorite bands before they disbanded in a small, intimate venue.&amp;nbsp; Sure, my parents thought I was nuts for waking up early and waiting 4 hours to get tickets, but I have no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, going to see concerts is certainly about the music, but it's also about the experience.&amp;nbsp; Whether it is Paul McCartney for the umpteenth time or a newly discovered band I think might be great live, I'm always up for going.&amp;nbsp; In this day and age, music is ubquitious and yet highly individual, whether it's on YouTube, the radio, someone's cell phone, or an mp3 player.&amp;nbsp; We cram our headphones into ears to block out everything else and we try to disappear into our own musical preferences.&amp;nbsp; A concert brings us out of these shells to share the experience with one another.&amp;nbsp; There's nothing like turning to the stranger next to you and grinning because your favorite song is being played live.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/1547660724582064045/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=1547660724582064045&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1547660724582064045'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1547660724582064045'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2012/01/why-going-to-concerts-cant-be-bad.html' title='Why Going to Concerts Can&apos;t Be Bad'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l1OPucL0gNo/TyfoYM4QaPI/AAAAAAAAAXA/wNnxpsswCl4/s72-c/4191818013_b17d1821fa.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-8522074093196774859</id><published>2011-10-05T15:31:00.005+02:00</published><updated>2011-10-20T16:27:32.116+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='reading'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='kindle'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='books'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ereader'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ebook'/><title type='text'>Why I Have Yet to Switch to E-Books</title><content type='html'>With the release last week of Amazon's new &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/technology/amazon-unveils-tablet-that-undercuts-ipads-price.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;Kindle Fire&lt;/a&gt;, I thought about the reasons why I haven't switched to e-books.  People who know me would think I would've jumped on that bandwagon already.  I love reading (see: my &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/psannielee"&gt;Goodreads page&lt;/a&gt; for all the books I've read and reviewed), I love technology, and I love gadgets.  An e-reader would seem to be the perfect fit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas, no.  I might sound like one of those militant audiophiles who prefer vinyl to CDs or God forbid digital music, but having a book in hand gives me a great sort of satisfaction.  There are several factors why I like books and brick-and-mortar bookstores:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The smell of a new book can't be beat.  The fresh, crisp pages and the ink have a very specific smell to them and I love that when I read.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I like sticking a bookmark in the book and seeing how much I've read and how much I've got left.  This is especially applicable to really thick books that are more than 500 pages long.  There's a certain pleasure that I get when I see how much I've read that I don't think is the same with an e-book.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The amount of space that books take up on my shelf also makes me happy.  Maybe I'm a snob in this regard, but I love being able to show off the books I've read.  It doesn't make me feel more intelligent (I wouldn't necessarily call Harry Potter reading for intelligent people), but it's more of a feeling of accomplishment.  I know some people don't give a rat's ass about how many books I've read in my life, but it's important to me.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Going to the bookstore and having a conversation with a salesperson is incomparable to getting an impersonal recommendation based on a few algorithms.  Talking to someone about why they loved or hated a book and having a good discussion or debate about is far better than just pulling up a review.  Yes, I'm on Goodreads, but for me, it's something that can start a discussion.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Going back to the smell of a book, the smell of a bookstore is also just heavenly.  I prefer the smell of new books to old musty ones, but either way, it's something you don't get with an e-book.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Browsing in a bookstore is not the same as browsing books online.  I know you can "look inside" books on certain websites, but not all pages are viewable.  I also like to just browse the shelves and walk through the store without having anything specific in mind.  It's a little harder for me to do that on Amazon or Barnes &amp;amp; Noble's website.&lt;br /&gt;7.  I can loan out physical books I have or borrow books my friends have read without any problem.  I don't think you can share books with people on the Kindle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting an e-reader would be excellent for traveling, of which I do a fair amount.  I remember I read all three of the books I had with me within the first week I was in Jordan with Christian.  It was a pain having to find an English language bookstore and when we did, I was lucky to find something I wanted.  It would've been much more convenient to just say, oh, I'm done reading everything, let's buy something else.  *click*  And it would've been much nicer sticking an e-reader in my bag instead of having four books taking up space in my suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, e-books can be just as expensive as a physical book and all you get is a PDF or some other file.  Why should I have to pay as much as a physical book when there's less involved?  There's no printing, shipping, or store costs.  The middleman is cut out, so you would think it would be cheaper.  If I knew that the author would get a good cut of the cost, then I'd pay it.  But based on some author interviews that I've read, I doubt that the author gets a decent pay from each book he or she sells.  I really don't think I want to pay $18.99 for Ken Follett's &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Fall of Giants&lt;/span&gt; for the Kindle when I can buy the paperback for $15.85 on Amazon.  With the paperback, I can loan it to people and I don't have to worry about the file getting corrupted or whatever.  Sure, you could argue that I could lose the paperback by leaving it in the train, but you can do that with the Kindle.  And then your whole library would be lost.  I realize that there are now clouds where you can backup your books or just get a hard drive and there are ways around losing files or your Kindle, just like a real physical book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that I used to be adamant about not buying an e-reader.  However, the new Kindle's price is very attractive.  But I'm still hesitating because I just don't want to have to pay the same amount of money for an e-book when I could just buy the physical one.  If Amazon or Barnes &amp;amp; Noble or some German store had a package deal combining the e-book and the physical book, I'd certainly be more willing to buy an e-reader.  Even if the package cost more, say, $20 for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Fall of Giants&lt;/span&gt;, but I got the e-book &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; the paperback, I'd definitely pay that.  And then if I wanted to buy the hardcover version with the e-book, just charge a little more, like $30.  Granted, I'm just throwing out rough prices here for a specific book, but I really would do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I'm just holding out to buy one because I really am a bibliophile.  I swap books with other expats here in Germany and I end up reading stuff I never would have otherwise.  If e-readers made it easier to loan books and/or changed the pricing, I think I would be more willing to have one just for traveling (especially with the new Kindle prices), though I don't think I'd ever give up physical books or going to the bookstore altogether.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/8522074093196774859/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=8522074093196774859&amp;isPopup=true' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/8522074093196774859'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/8522074093196774859'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2011/10/why-i-have-yet-to-switch-to-e-books.html' title='Why I Have Yet to Switch to E-Books'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-3236233449524445658</id><published>2011-09-25T17:08:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2011-09-25T17:59:46.946+02:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Five-Albums Test</title><content type='html'>If anyone doesn't read the reviews from&lt;a href="www.avclub.com"&gt; A.V. Club&lt;/a&gt;, you should.  They're usually insightful and funny, and if you're reading what I write, I find I have the same opinions of many of the A.V. Club's writers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to Steven Hyden's July 19th article, &lt;a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-fivealbums-test,59098/"&gt;The Five-Albums Test&lt;/a&gt;.  I've been thinking about it a lot recently and to sum it up, Hyden suggests the five-albums test as a rubric to an artist's greatness.  He believes that having five consecutive albums is a truly difficult feat and he writes, "Lots of artists have five or more classic albums (not including EPs or  live records), but the ability to string them together back-to-back  means being in the kind of zone that’s normally associated with dominant  college women’s basketball dynasties."  Amongst the groups that would pass Hyden's test are The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Queen, and Fountains of Wayne.  Yes, you read that correctly, Fountains of Wayne, the group who had that one radio hit "Stacy's Mom."  Moreover, he admits that Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, and Guided By Voices would not pass this test if he looks objectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not going to go through Hyden's arguments because you can obviously read the article yourself, but I think it makes sense.  Nowadays bands take forever to release material and some don't even stick around long enough to produce five albums.  The Beatles released about two albums &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;per year&lt;/span&gt; in 1963, 1964, and 1965 and they were touring to promote the albums.  Granted, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;With The Beatles&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Beatles for Sale&lt;/span&gt; had many covers and the early albums' production time was considerably less than say, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&lt;/span&gt;, but even the quality of material that they produced is incredible.  Some may argue that the music industry has changed since The Beatles and yes, that's true.  Bands and performers venture out to do other projects (I'm still waiting for Justin Timberlake to release another album after &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;FutureSex/LoveSounds&lt;/span&gt; but it seems acting has gotten in the way of his musical career) and have side bands (how many side projects does Jack White have?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I think that's what makes the five albums test even more meaningful in this day and age.  It really is something incredible if a band or artist is around long enough to put out enough material for five albums and all five of them are great.  Look at Weezer, one of my favorite bands.  I was surprised with the release of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Raditude&lt;/span&gt; in 2009 after &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Red Album&lt;/span&gt; came out only a year earlier, and then &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Hurley&lt;/span&gt; came out in 2010.  But honestly, you can't compare the quality of the three albums to each other, and never mind the comparison to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Blue Album&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Pinkerton&lt;/span&gt;.  There are some great songs that if you picked and chose and stuck them together, they would make one really great Weezer album.  But instead, we have three decent albums with a lot of fluff between the best songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are bands that I've really liked that put out an album and made me into one of those people that bemoans the passing of the "old stuff," including The Killers (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Day &amp;amp; Age&lt;/span&gt; was terrible), Garbage (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Beautiful Garbage&lt;/span&gt; was horribly disappointing after &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Version 2.0&lt;/span&gt; and I didn't even pick up &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Bleed Like Me&lt;/span&gt;), and Flogging Molly (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Float&lt;/span&gt; didn't feel like Flogging Molly anymore).  I'm always willing to give the bands another shot because there are definitely duds (like The Beatles' &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Yellow Submarine&lt;/span&gt;), but I generally approach them again with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I think the Five-Albums Test isn't just applicable to music.  I was talking to my sister about TV shows and how they sometimes seem to run forever, even after they've run out of steam.  Shows that are really great have five consecutive seasons that are written and acted well and don't get old.  I'll admit that I'm not a television expert by any means, but I just remember watching shows for about five seasons and then they seemed to go downhill from there, like &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Scrubs&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Will &amp;amp; Grace&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Friends&lt;/span&gt;.  I'm not saying that there aren't individual episodes that are good, but the shows seem to just stop being interesting.  I'm so glad that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Lost&lt;/span&gt; only had six seasons because seriously, the last season was a bit ridiculous, as was the second or third (I can't remember which one) because they needed to figure out the direction of the show.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/3236233449524445658'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/3236233449524445658'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-884624027281005014</id><published>2011-07-31T19:23:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-07-31T21:47:15.488+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Two new music videos: Björk &amp; OK Go</title><content type='html'>There are two new music videos that were released this week: Björk's collaboration with Michel Gondry for her song "Crystalline" and OK Go's HTML5/Google Chrome extravaganza for "All is Not Lost."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's start with "Crystalline."  I'll be honest: I am not a Björk fan and I do not like her music.  Creatively, she has so many ideas and executes them well (I mean, everyone remembers her &lt;a href="http://static2.stuff.co.nz/1233108507/576/670576.jpg"&gt;swan dress&lt;/a&gt; from the 2001 Oscars, right?).  But the music itself just rubs me the wrong way.  It doesn't excite me, it doesn't make me want to sing along or dance, it doesn't put me in a good mood.  For me, that's what music is supposed to do.  Björk's music makes me want to fall asleep or rip my hair out; it's similar to hearing fingernails on a blackboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wZhkfwrxNOc" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" width="425"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But her music videos are always something to behold (see: collaboration with Chris Cunningham for "&lt;a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3asce_bjork-all-is-full-of-love_music"&gt;All is Full of Love&lt;/a&gt;" and her work with Spike Jonze for "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htobTBlCvUU"&gt;It's Oh So Quiet&lt;/a&gt;").  And her latest music video with Michel Gondry is also admirable, though I have to disagree with &lt;a href="http://jezebel.com/5826242/let-bjork-and-michel-gondry-blow-your-mind"&gt;Jezebel&lt;/a&gt; who said it would "blow your mind."  I like the frame by frame shots and the squiggly lines of color.  The little beams of light that hit the surface of the moon remind me of the fight scenes in&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; Jason and the Argonauts&lt;/span&gt; from 1963.  Don't get me wrong, I love the analog feel of it, but "blowing my mind" is not how I'd describe it.  Gondry has more memorable videos than this one, as does Björk.  It's a cute, interesting video, but nothing super memorable.  Again, maybe this is because I don't like Björk's music, but this is not something I would immediately forward to someone and say, "Check this out."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we want to talk about minds being blown, OK Go released a new interactive music video on Tuesday for their song "All is Not Lost."  You can go to the interactive video&lt;a href="http://www.allisnotlo.st"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.allisnotlo.st"&gt;at the website they created for i&lt;/a&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;, though here is the standard, non-interactive video:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ur-y7oOto14" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar to Arcade Fire's &lt;a href="http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/"&gt;"The Wilderness Downtown&lt;/a&gt;," OK Go uses technology to make the music video come alive.  I'm not even sure I would necessarily call these approaches "music videos" anymore, not in the sense of what used to play on MTV.  I think Arcade Fire's video is also really amazing, but OK Go's is also visually a lot more complex.  I can't imagine what it must've been like to have to choreograph a dance from below and then making the windows work in time with music. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music video in this case doesn't just work on the visual and aural levels.  It's not just music, text, and visuals anymore because the viewer is now also a user and controls the experience of the video.  Every view is unique to the audience.  Of course, the video can be viewed multiple times with the same message (or address in "The Wilderness Downtown"), but the overall concept is that the audience is helping to shape the experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Björk's "Crystalline" video and OK Go's "All Is Not Lost" project show is that there are still different approaches to the music video.  "Crystalline" is perhaps a little more traditional, though it leans more towards the artistic.  In the footsteps of "The Wilderness Downtown" "All Is Not Lost" is pushing the video towards something different and what that is, we'll see if other bands follow.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/884624027281005014/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=884624027281005014&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/884624027281005014'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/884624027281005014'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2011/07/two-new-music-videos-bjork-ok-go.html' title='Two new music videos: Björk &amp; OK Go'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://img.youtube.com/vi/wZhkfwrxNOc/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-5066137394867292159</id><published>2011-07-23T23:59:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2011-07-24T00:35:57.138+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='masters'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music video'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ok go'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='lady gaga'/><title type='text'>It's been far too long.</title><content type='html'>I realize I haven't written on my blog in forever.  I think part of it is that I feel like I've gotten settled here in Germany and nothing is as surprising or as new as it once was.  Looking back at my entries from 2005 make me laugh, especially if I wrote something in German.  I've noticed my written German and grammar in general has improved.  That's always a plus.  Another part of not writing on the blog so often is that I feel with the growth of other short social media forms, especially Facebook, it's been a bit unnecessary to write longer entries.  Lastly, I still write in my handwritten journal that I've been keeping since the first grade, so writing this seems perhaps a bit superfluous.  (I mean, let's face it, does anyone actually read this?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, since I stopped writing I've gone back to studying and I'm almost done with my master's.  I just need to write my thesis.  It's refreshing right now to take a step back from it and just write about writing it (if that makes any sense whatsoever).  I've been reading a lot, but I found it surprising that very little material is available on my topic specifically -- music videos and YouTube.  It probably isn't a shock that that's the topic I've chosen to write about, especially considering that:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I am a child of the 80s.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I love watching music videos.&lt;br /&gt;3.  I'm always online and I love the fact that I can watch old music videos that I haven't seen in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hypothesis is that with the rise in YouTube and technology like iPods, iPads, and smartphones, music videos are seeing a renaissance.  Two artist have inspired me so much that I'm going to dedicate a whole section to their videos in my thesis: OK Go and Lady Gaga.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK Go seemed like the obvious choice because I've been a fan of theirs since 2004.  Seeing their videos go on viral on the internet was exciting and fascinating.  How is it that this little known band came to be so popular purely through the use of the internet?  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, here's their video for their song "Here It Goes Again:"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/8267567?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" height="300" width="400"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/8267567"&gt;OK Go - Here It Goes Again&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/user2495615"&gt;OK Go&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, their music videos aren't just music videos; they are works of art.  (Check out their videos for &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;"This Too Shall Pass"&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;a href="http://www.iviewtube.com/v/157023/ok-go-end-love-%28official-music-video%29"&gt;End Love&lt;/a&gt;", and "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkYfB1C0Zgc&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;Last Leaf"&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, I wasn't ever a huge Lady Gaga fan and I certainly never considered myself a Little Monster. Then I saw her video for "Telephone":&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="324" width="575"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.vevo.com/VideoPlayer/Embedded?videoId=USUV70904469&amp;amp;playlist=false&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;playerId=62FF0A5C-0D9E-4AC1-AF04-1D9E97EE3961&amp;amp;playerType=embedded&amp;amp;env=0"&gt;&lt;param name="wmode" value="transparent"&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.vevo.com/VideoPlayer/Embedded?videoId=USUV70904469&amp;amp;playlist=false&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;playerId=62FF0A5C-0D9E-4AC1-AF04-1D9E97EE3961&amp;amp;playerType=embedded&amp;amp;env=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" bgcolor="#000000" wmode="transparent" height="324" width="575"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don't consider myself a huge Gaga fan or a Little Monster, but I don't know what it is about this video.  I can watch it over and over again without getting tired of it.  There's just &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;so much&lt;/span&gt; material in it: &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Jailhouse Rock&lt;/span&gt; homage or maybe &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Chicago&lt;/span&gt;, the weird ad placements (Virgin Mobile, Wonder Bread), references to Tarantino movies (most blatant with the Pussy Wagon) and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Thelma &amp;amp; Louise&lt;/span&gt;, the fact that it's a continuation from her "Paparazzi" video.  But "Telephone" isn't Lady Gaga's only interesting video; they're all really highly produced, well-polished spectacles and they're the complete opposite of OK Go, who tends to do more low-production stuff.  Neither is better than the other, but that's why I want to look at both artists.  How do they use YouTube/developing technology to their advantages?  Are their music videos more relevant to developing their image because the videos are actually accessible and visible?  It's questions like these that interest me in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with that in mind, I guess that's where I'll be picking up this blog again.  It's not so much a blog about being an expat in Germany, though there will still be observations about that.  Maybe then I'll actually keep up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/5066137394867292159/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=5066137394867292159&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5066137394867292159'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5066137394867292159'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2011/07/its-been-far-too-long.html' title='It&apos;s been far too long.'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-7681034553252691125</id><published>2009-12-12T00:27:00.004+01:00</published><updated>2009-12-12T13:22:53.429+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Reflections on a Decade: The 2000s</title><content type='html'>As a reminder that the decade is going to be over in less than 20 days, let's review what this decade was like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started off with Y2K (hooray!  We all survived!  And the coming of Web 2.0 has made it possible for me to write this and share it with you!) and then there was the whole Napster shenanigans, two elections in the United States that left many people scratching their heads, 9/11, iPods and Apple took over the world, a lot of political stuff I don't really feel like getting into, the blur of the mid-2000s, and ok, let's bring it up to now: a black man was elected to the highest office in the United States, we have one of the biggest recessions in recent decades and global warming is on the rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmm...it looks like this decade for me could be summed up into two categories: politics and technology.  I know I glossed over a LOT of stuff, but just pick up any news magazine and I'm sure it'll go into it for you.  Let's move on to the less serious stuff, shall we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've picked out 20 albums of the 2000s that are significant for me for some reason or another.  Here they are with just a sentence or two about why they're on this list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;20 Albums of the 2000s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;'N Sync - No Strings Attached&lt;/span&gt; (2000) - I was 15.  End of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Living End - Roll On (2000)&lt;/span&gt; - My penpal introduced me to The Living End with this album.  I just loved the mix of rockabilly and punk music together and have been a fan ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Hives - Veni Vidi Vicious&lt;/span&gt; (2000) - For me, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCQ7VLoY7bQ"&gt;"Hate to Say I Told You So"&lt;/a&gt; was really catchy and the album was a return of rock the way it should be: loud, fuzzy guitars that are fun to dance to.  Not only that, I was impressed with the matching suits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Weezer - The Green Album&lt;/span&gt; (2001) - It took Weezer long enough to put out an album after 1996's &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Pinkerton&lt;/span&gt;.  I liked this album when it came out; I'll admit it.  A bit pop-y in comparison to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Pinkerton&lt;/span&gt;, but hey, Weezer was back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Flogging Molly - Drunken Lullabies &lt;/span&gt;(2002) - By far, Flogging Molly's best album.  I think I had gone to the Vans Warped Tour in 2002 and they played stuff off &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Drunken Lullabies&lt;/span&gt;.  It was perfect for that and it still hasn't lost its charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Donnas - Spend the Night&lt;/span&gt; (2002) - Three words: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mPKC6UDiks"&gt;"Take It Off."&lt;/a&gt;  Not to mention this was The Donnas' breakout album, but it was really fantastic seeing a girl punk band I could see myself relating to if I hadn't been a teenager (aka awkward).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;OK Go - OK Go&lt;/span&gt; (2002) - OK Go's debut album.  Most people would pick their album &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Oh No &lt;/span&gt;since they made it big with &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJulhGUh8vU"&gt;"Here it Goes Again,"&lt;/a&gt; but I discovered OK Go with their self-titled and no, I'm not just saying that, I really did.  I immediately fell in love with the album because it was fun, catchy, danceable, and smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kylie Minogue - Fever&lt;/span&gt; (2002) - There are so many good songs on this album: "Come into my World," "In Your Eyes," "Love at First Sight," and of course, "Can't Get You Outta My Head."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The White Stripes - White Blood Cells&lt;/span&gt; (2002) - I just remember seeing the video for &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q27BfBkRHbs"&gt;"Fell in Love with a Girl"&lt;/a&gt; and thinking it was the coolest video in a long time.  This reconfirmed my belief that loud, fuzzy guitars were back (see above, #3, The Hives' &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Veni Vidi Vicious&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Queens of the Stone Age - Songs for the Deaf&lt;/span&gt; (2002) - Dave Grohl was the guest drummer on this album, I think.  I loved the bass line for "No One Knows."  Also the video for &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBwWUfLlglw"&gt;"Go with the Flow"&lt;/a&gt; was pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Outkast - Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&lt;/span&gt; (2003) - Two albums at once?!  Why not.  There were 3 songs in particular that will never, ever get old, even 6 years later: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zvkV8e_rdU"&gt;"Hey Ya!,"&lt;/a&gt; "The Way You Move," and "Roses."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ratatat - Ratatat&lt;/span&gt; (2003) - I saw Ratatat perform on Middlebury's campus.  They played this album in its entirety in about an hour.  And they played it again.  And again.  Mostly because everyone was so into it.  It was a ton of fun and the best thing...it was free!  (And before everyone on campus started listening to it so the show wasn't overrun.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Green Day - American Idiot&lt;/span&gt; (2004) - Ok, so their album &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Warning&lt;/span&gt; came out in 2000 and I had liked it.  It was different.  But &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;American Idiot&lt;/span&gt; was just a completely new level.  Who else could've pulled off a punk rock opera other than Green Day?  And that is exactly why this album is on this list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Franz Ferdinand - Franz Ferdinand &lt;/span&gt;(2004) - Fun, danceable, catchy rock.  And if music could be described as "sexy," yes, this album is definitely sexy.  This album still hasn't gotten old and I remember comparing it to The Strokes' &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Room on Fire&lt;/span&gt;.  To say the least, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Franz Ferdinand&lt;/span&gt; is such a better album and they're such a better band.  Hence why I still like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kelly Clarkson - Breakaway&lt;/span&gt; (2004) - Kelly Clarkson is probably my guilty pleasure of the decade and this album had a lot of really good songs on it. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMMvEIjr3CI"&gt; "Since U Been Gone"&lt;/a&gt; is probably my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters - In Your Honor&lt;/span&gt; (2005) - Admittedly I couldn't decide which FF album from this decade should go on here, especially considering that their best is still &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Colour and the Shape&lt;/span&gt; (which came out in '97).  So I just arbitrarily picked &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;In Your Honor&lt;/span&gt; because it's got two CDs, the slow stuff and the fast stuff.  However, FF have put out some really great music in the last 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Wir Sind Helden - Von hier an blind&lt;/span&gt; (2005) - This was the first German album I purchased living in Germany.  Alex and I first heard &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-FaSIPszsY"&gt;"Nur ein Wort"&lt;/a&gt; in a Berlin Dunkin' Donuts in Zoologischer Garten and we turned to each other, agreeing simultaneously that the song was super catchy.  It defined my year abroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Killers - Sam's Town&lt;/span&gt; (2006) - In comparison to their debut album &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Hot Fuss&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Sam's Town&lt;/span&gt; is just a fantastic record because it works as an idea.  I'm not even sure it was a concept album, but that's what I got from it.  It's a lot tighter than their first release and they really seemed to fine-tune their presence with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;19.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Justin Timberlake - FutureSex/LoveSounds&lt;/span&gt; (2006) - Another fantastic pop album.  I don't even really know what to say, except I find myself listening to this every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Radiohead - In Rainbows&lt;/span&gt; (2007) - This isn't on here for its content; rather, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;In Rainbows &lt;/span&gt;is significant because it was the first album to be released on the internet by the band themselves and then people were allowed to choose how much they wanted to pay for it.  Even nothing.  Good job Radiohead for trying to change the digital music industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like after 2007, there wasn't anything significant on my list.  That's not true; there are some bands I would've liked to put on, but hey, I needed to keep this list short.  On the other hand, everything released after 2007 that would be on this list are just other albums from artists already on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for movies, I can't really make a list because I don't own a lot movies from the last few years and it's not as easy to look at as my music in iTunes.  (Yay sorting by year.)  However, I think for me the most significant movie(s) this decade has to be &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Lord of the Rings Trilogy&lt;/span&gt;.  I don't think I've met anyone that hasn't seen these movies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a more personal note, this decade is probably the first that I can remember in its entirety.  I remember exactly where I was and whom I was with when I rang in the new millenium.  This decade, I got both my high school and bachelor degrees, started working on my master's, and have lived in Germany for a total of three years.  In essence, I've become what some may consider an adult, which is a bit strange to think about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows what will happen in the next decade, but I do have my guesses....Let's get ready for the 10s!!!  (teens?  tens?  How will we even say them?)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/7681034553252691125/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=7681034553252691125&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7681034553252691125'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7681034553252691125'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/12/reflections-on-decade-2000s.html' title='Reflections on a Decade: The 2000s'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-5982589651977475757</id><published>2009-12-10T14:29:00.003+01:00</published><updated>2009-12-10T15:30:09.686+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Soundtrack 2009</title><content type='html'>As the end of the year draws near, a lot of reflection is usually done.  My sister Tracie wrote an entry on her blog of the same title and I thought it a good idea.  I haven't made a yearly soundtrack since I left college, but I got inspired from my sister's entry.  So here are some songs that represent 2009 for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6b6yhsqps4"&gt;Franz Ferdinand "Ulysses"&lt;/a&gt; - This song kept me going on the S-bahn platform at 6:30 in the morning quite often when it first came out.  I had been anticipating the release of their album "Tonight: Franz Ferdinand" and it didn't disappoint.  Not to mention that I won tickets for their show in November and I was so excited to hear this live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOavkUZbbyg"&gt;The Living End "Hey Hey Disbeliever"&lt;/a&gt; - The Living End came on tour to Europe and their album &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;White Noise&lt;/span&gt; was &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; released over here (still hasn't been released in the U.S. to my knowledge).  Too bad I didn't see them on their second go around, but I gave up that opportunity to save money for Paul McCartney.  (More on that in a bit)  But The Living End was still amazing live, though I hadn't seen them in quite a bit.  This song just rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGR8gW66iqY"&gt;Green Day "Horseshoes and Handgrenades"&lt;/a&gt; - I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that Green Day's audience gets younger and younger while I get older.  I was disappointed that they didn't play this song when I saw them, in addition to the fact that they didn't sing "Welcome to Paradise."  (C'mon, Green Day!)  I'm not sure I would say the album 21st Century Breakdown was a highlight of this year, though I had been excited for the album's release.  There was certainly better music released, but Green Day's music has developed into a style that's definitely better for arena shows.  And they definitely are a good arena show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MKz0gkcgAo"&gt;Katy Perry "Hot n Cold"&lt;/a&gt; - Yup, a pop song.  This song for me was really infectious.  The link I put up is to a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Twilight&lt;/span&gt; parody with "Hot n Cold" in it.  It's pretty hilarious.  I'm by no means a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Twilight&lt;/span&gt; fan (actually, far from it.  I hate it), but somehow the song is super-fitting.  "Hot n Cold" was also everywhere here for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLsQ_8PwwDs"&gt;Calexico "The Crystal Frontier (Widescreen Version)"&lt;/a&gt; - Ok, this song is old.  And yes, I saw Calexico in October 2008.  Doesn't matter.  This song is just pure awesomeness and it was on my iPod on repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides these five songs, this song was actually dominated by The Beatles.  Sure, their last recorded album, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/span&gt;, was released 40 years ago, but this year was almost like 1995-1996 when the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Anthology&lt;/span&gt; was released.  For one, the digital remasters were released.  Admittedly, I haven't heard them yet except for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Let it Be&lt;/span&gt; (which I bought separately since they were released only in stereo) because they're waiting for me at home in the U.S. unopened, so I can't tell you if they're good or not.  But there were so many reviews about them that it was as if new Beatles albums had been released.  According to some, these remastered CDs were like experiencing the albums for the first time.  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Beatles: Rock Band&lt;/span&gt; was also released, but I haven't bought it nor played it out of fear that it will destroy my perception of the music.  Maybe we'll see about that in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the remastered CDs' release, I went to &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2009/09/liverpool-england-pilgrimage.html"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, home of the Fab Four.  And finally, I'll be seeing Paul McCartney in a week in the Köln Arena.  So besides the five songs above, I'd have to add these particular songs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  The Beatles "Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End" - I think this medley is just amazing, especially because The Beatles knew that this was the last album they would record together.  It's a pretty good ending, isn't it?  (Ok, if you don't count "Her Majesty.")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  The Beatles "Maggie Mae" - Until I went to Liverpool, I didn't realize how this song is sung with their Scouser accent.  I think I have a better appreciation for it because of my trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  Paul McCartney "Only Mama Knows" - Because I'm seeing Paul next week, I bought his album &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Memory Almost Full&lt;/span&gt;.  When it first came out, I was originally against it because it was released through Starbucks, but after a first listen, I actually really liked it.  I'm pretty sure he'll be playing this song next week, so to say the least, I'm excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot wait to hear the mono remastered CDs when I get home in a week and a half.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/5982589651977475757/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=5982589651977475757&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5982589651977475757'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5982589651977475757'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/12/soundtrack-2009.html' title='Soundtrack 2009'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-2948411997264479261</id><published>2009-09-18T13:05:00.004+02:00</published><updated>2009-09-18T14:43:02.318+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Liverpool, England: A Pilgrimage</title><content type='html'>Liverpool.  Liverpool?  I needed to get out of Germany (sometimes it happens) and having been to London several times before, Liverpool seemed perfect.  Anyone who knows me knows I'm a huge Beatles fan.  Christian had to go to Munich for a few days for work, so going by myself seemed ideal; I wouldn't have to drag anyone only vaguely interested around with me doing Beatles-related stuff.  Plus, I had been to London so many times before, but I had never seen any other parts of England.  Lastly, I just wanted some time by myself (again, sometimes it happens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2531/3930586591_a99089ab25.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 324px; height: 243px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2531/3930586591_a99089ab25.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a little less than 72 hours in the city on the River Mersey, but I did everything I could, whether or not it related to the Beatles.  I really loved Albert Dock; it's so beautiful and just &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;cool&lt;/span&gt;.  It doesn't exude an air of poshness (for crying out loud, it was a dock used for industry), but somehow it's very elegant, tranquil, and charming.  The restaurants there are surprisingly very affordable, the Tate Liverpool is free, as are the other museums.  &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3521/3931316356_da358ffb25.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 313px; height: 234px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3521/3931316356_da358ffb25.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And I just absolutely adore the red brick stone with the black paneled windows.  It would be really fantastic to live there, though I can only wonder how much apartments there cost.  The Liverpool Cathedral is the fifth largest in the world (depending on the criteria, because it could actually be the largest and one of the longest) and when you enter it, it's really breathtaking how &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;huge&lt;/span&gt; it is.  I thought it was far more impressive than the Cologne Cathedral and it's much brighter, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly north of Albert Dock are the Three Graces at the Pier Head (the Royal Liver Building, Cunard Building, and Port of Liverpool Building).  They're also really very impressive and make for a gorgeous skyline, albeit completely different than the towering skylines of New York and Hong &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2436/3931374108_0b31745f1b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 316px; height: 237px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2436/3931374108_0b31745f1b.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Kong.  And that's the thing: Liverpool isn't a big city, but it's incredibly pleasant, laid back, and has a lot of personality.  It's a mix of old (Three Graces, Albert Dock, Liverpool Cathedral, little English houses) with the super modern (Liverpool ONE, Chavasse Park, new developments) and the people are really super friendly, though if you come across someone with a really thick Scouse accent, it's a bit harder to understand.  I certainly heard some people that reminded me of Brad Pitt's character in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Lock, Stock, &amp;amp; Two Smoking Barrels&lt;/span&gt;.  However, when I've been alone in London, people seemed to pity me or think it was weird.  Not so in Liverpool.  Nobody seemed to think twice of it, though they were first surprised.  Maybe it's because they get so many crazy Beatles fans coming by themselves, ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Wednesday, I took a &lt;a href="http://www.fabfourtaxitours.com/"&gt;Fab Four Taxi Tour&lt;/a&gt; thinking that because I was by myself, they'd probably stick me with a group of two or three other people.  Nope.  I got a private tour all by myself!  My tour guide, Alan, picked me up at my hotel at exactly the time I had requested and we drove all over the city.  He was extraordinarily knowledgeable and informative and not just about Beatles things.  We talked about how the city was a European City of Culture last year, how it changed a lot of things (real estate prices, for example), what the city is really like.  We went everywhere: John, Paul, George, and Ringo's childhood homes, Brian Epstein's apartment where he let John &amp;amp; Cynthia stay after they married, Penny Lane, Strawberry Field, the place where John &amp;amp; Paul met for the first time...It was really a pilgrimage of sorts for any Beatles fan and it really gives you a new perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2534/3931376830_9c90e38087_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 180px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2534/3931376830_9c90e38087_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the tour, I did the Beatles Story Museum, which long story short, is not worth it if you're a hardcore fan.  Nothing new was presented.  Afterward, I went to the Cavern Club.  The original Cavern Club was torn down years ago, but a few doors down is another Cavern Club that recreates the original.  Admittedly, it was a bit strange to go alone and have a beer by myself since it was the first time I've ever been to a bar without anyone, but I chatted to a guy old enough to be my dad who worked for the Conservation Society (or something along those lines...preserving buildings in Liverpool).  He was also alone, but seemed to have had a bit much to drink.  But the anonymity of talking to a complete stranger and leaving it at that is one of the thrills of traveling alone...these acquaintances you make for about an hour or two and leave it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2654/3931382242_3f419fe93a_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 180px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2654/3931382242_3f419fe93a_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;However, being in the Cavern Club, or a reproduction of the original, was really exciting.  I could just imagine how sweaty, stuffy, smoky, and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;loud&lt;/span&gt; it must've been.  Sitting in the corner, I could imagine the Beatles on stage as the Quarry Men with a gaggle of girls in front of them, screaming their support and encouragement.  Today, there's no smoking allowed (as in all English bars) and the place is filled with mostly picture-taking tourists eager, like me, to experience what it must've been like.  Instead of the Beatles (or Quarry Men) on stage, there was a John Lennon impersonator dressed with the "New York City" shirt and "granny glasses" singing Beatles and Lennon songs acoustically.  He did a pretty good job and looked the part, except for the fact that he had a beer gut and was a little heavier than John ever was (at least based on pictures I've seen, even in comparison to his "fat Elvis phase" during the filming of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Help!.&lt;/span&gt;)  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and being with oodles of other Beatles fans belting out tunes and drinking beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I hated about Liverpool was the fashion.  I'm not sure if this is just in Liverpool or if it's taking over England, but dear God, the 80s are back in full force.  I saw sequined dresses with big shoulders, neon colors like nowhere else, animal prints in non-animal print colors (for example, green zebra stripes, dark blue leopard print), blazers with a horrible cut, girls wearing their hair big and with bows in them (I kid you not), horrible colored make-up that is very heavy, big t-shirts being worn with only leggings &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;with stirrups&lt;/span&gt;.  I went shopping thinking I could find some interesting clothing, and interesting is a word you could use to describe the fashion, but I would describe it more as "vomit-inducing."  I really hate 80s fashion.  I really hate animal prints (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;especially&lt;/span&gt; leopard print).  I really hate neon.  And so, sorry, Liverpool, but I hate the fashion at the moment.  Terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I know I'll be back in Liverpool someday.&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3528/3930596257_1acc5fde9f_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 180px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3528/3930596257_1acc5fde9f_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  It's such a lovely city and the people are so open.  Plus, I still need to go to the Casbah Coffee Club and see where John, George, and Pete Best decorated it and played there as the Quarry Men (Paul included of course).  However, for the non-Beatles fans, Liverpool is a much more affordable city than London and has a lot to offer in terms of shopping, eating, and site-seeing.  Well, the shopping options are there, but the fashion is something else entirely.  Hopefully that'll change.  Otherwise, it was a well-needed break from Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here are a few other pictures that I though were relevant for the trip or that I liked, though you can see them all on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee/sets/72157622278032483/"&gt;Flickr set&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3160/3931370326_7604a90938_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 180px; height: 240px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3160/3931370326_7604a90938_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;The walkway on Albert Dock along the Mersey in black &amp;amp; white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2480/3931374452_654154210d_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 180px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2480/3931374452_654154210d_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;A statue of Billy Fury, another famous Scouser, at sunset&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;on Albert Dock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3423/3930596463_7f4ba4d5b9_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 180px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3423/3930596463_7f4ba4d5b9_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Me at Strawberry Field, or what remains of it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2668/3930595767_d9d45d3210_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 180px; height: 240px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2668/3930595767_d9d45d3210_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;The place where John &amp;amp; Paul met for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;A plaque on the wall commemorates the event that changed history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/2948411997264479261/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=2948411997264479261&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2948411997264479261'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2948411997264479261'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/09/liverpool-england-pilgrimage.html' title='Liverpool, England: A Pilgrimage'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2531/3930586591_a99089ab25_t.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-872591801360764903</id><published>2009-07-30T21:18:00.005+02:00</published><updated>2009-07-31T21:12:18.529+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Visiting the Troops in Landstuhl Medical Center</title><content type='html'>Although I've lived here for three years already, there's always something new to experience, even if it has to do with my own country.  On July 18, I went down to Kaiserslautern with some fellow members of the Democrats Abroad to visit the soldiers in the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.  We wanted to do it to show them our appreciation for their sacrifices and hard work that they've done, plus it's always fun to spend the day with some fellow Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine of us went down and I was the only one who had ever been on an American base before (I found this strange, but then again, I never know what to expect from people anymore).  I think it might've came as a surprise that security is so tight even for American civilians trying to get on base.  Our guide, Staff Sergeant Griffin, had been on call because a plane full of soldiers had arrived earlier in the morning at 1 a.m.  By the time we got to the base at around 1:30 p.m, she was obviously exhausted but nonetheless cheerful and informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2594/3735258050_60216f3fb3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 343px; height: 257px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2594/3735258050_60216f3fb3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We got a basic but in-depth introduction from a Navy Sergeant Griffin (no relation to our guide) who informed us of the inner workings of the Landstuhl Medical Center.  To my astonishment, the majority of soldiers are not there due to "battle injuries" (gun shot wounds, being burned after an explosion, etc.), but because they got sick on their deployment or because they have regular every day injuries (breaking an arm playing football, dropping a pan of hot oil or something while cooking, etc.).  Landstuhl is also the first stop for anyone "down range," that is, in Iraq or Afghanistan, though people stationed in other parts of the world (the Balkans, eastern Europe, Africa) may also end up there.  If soldiers are well enough to be transferred, they won't stay in Landstuhl long; the majority only stay for two or three days up to fourteen days and then are brought to hospitals in the States.  If they recover (from illness, for example), however, they will be sent back to their place of deployment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then got a tour of the facility itself and it's no different from any other hospital you would see in the U.S.  They even have a maternity ward!  OK, maybe there were a few obvious differences, &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3431/3734460299_8b2350b163_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 180px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3431/3734460299_8b2350b163_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;like the fact that many of the people walking around have some sort of camouflage clothing on.  Even some of the doctors and nurses worked in camo-scrubs.  Additionally, there were some signs that were in both German and English, but for the most part, it's not super noticeable.  The hospital also didn't have a very hospital-y smell to it and frankly I don't know why that is.  But the cafeteria served American food, there was a convenience store with American goods, even the vending machines only accepted dollars.  (We actually had to ask Staff Sergeant Griffin if she had any extra dollar bills since none of us had any on us and some people were dying to get to the Reese's Pieces.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlight though was being able to talk to some of the patients. I had the opportunity to speak with two soldiers: an older man suffering from pancreatitis and a young 19-year-old suffering from pneumonia.  Both had been stationed in Afghanistan; the former had been in Landstuhl only a few days and could barely get any sort of food or water in his system and the latter had just arrived the morning we got there.  What was really interesting was that both soldiers were really sad, even disappointed, that they couldn't be in Afghanistan.  They felt that they were actually helping the people there and making a difference.  The first soldier's job was to help locals get electricity (I think) and the second searched for improvised explosive devices (IEDs).  Though the jobs were quite different, both soldiers believed that they were helping improve lives in Afghanistan little by little and that the media's portrayal of the situation focused too heavily on the negative.  And they're right: why couldn't the media focus more on the positive aspects?  The obvious answer is that nobody cares about good news and that it doesn't sell; however, I think it would really give people a different perspective of things if we got these personal stories out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soldiers seemed to be appreciative of our visit and bringing them (German) chocolate and toiletries seemed to brighten them up a little bit.  We also thanked the nursing staff for all that they do and they were really excited to get some chocolate as well.  &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3532/3734459765_8b2e62617a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 297px; height: 222px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3532/3734459765_8b2e62617a.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It was truly a perspective-changing experience to know that soldiers aren't going there for mostly battle wounds at the moment; the situations in Afghanistan and Iraq are not nearly as bad as we think they are.  The soldiers were also just glad to know that there were people in the outside world thinking of them and that they haven't just been forgotten (especially since the withdrawl of American troops from Iraqi cities).  I think it's really important for their morale to know that and it's quite obvious from the fact that everyone who was there when President Obama visited in June was completely pumped to talk about the experience.  It wasn't even when he had been in Germany when he went to Buchenwald with Angela Merkel; it was a separate visit with no media, no cameras, not even the remotest hint of planning.  It was simply just to visit the troops and say thanks.  And because of the way it happened, I think it really made an impact on the soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides visiting soldiers who were confined to the wards, we also had the opportunity to visit a little building run by the &lt;a href="http://uso.org/"&gt;USO&lt;/a&gt;.  There, soldiers who could move around and get around on their own could watch movies, play on XBoxes or Wiis, play cards, cook, check their email, video record themselves reading a book to their children, read books, or call home.  Essentially, it's to make the soldiers feel a little closer to home while being away.  We donated a poker set and the volunteers were so excited because they could now hold a Texas Hold 'Em tournament with more people.  It was really wonderful to see what the USO does for our troops to make them as comfortable as possible, so if you want to do something for our troops, check what the USO needs...they always could use something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I want to say about the Landstuhl visit is that it really did change a lot of our perspectives.  The wars (missions, jobs, whatever you want to call it) in Iraq and Afghanistan are far from over and there's a lot of work still to be done.  Though the events don't make really big headlines like they used to, we can't forget that people are still over there risking their lives trying to improve the lives of others.  Normally I don't like being super political with my blog, but I think it's something we really need to be more aware of.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/872591801360764903/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=872591801360764903&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/872591801360764903'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/872591801360764903'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/07/visiting-troops-in-landstuhl-medical.html' title='Visiting the Troops in Landstuhl Medical Center'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2594/3735258050_60216f3fb3_t.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-2981944248208025792</id><published>2009-07-05T14:20:00.005+02:00</published><updated>2009-07-16T15:04:39.245+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Free Music: The Rheinkultur Festival in Bonn</title><content type='html'>July 4th weekend was the Rheinkultur Festival in Bonn, which is one of the biggest free open air festivals in Germany.  If you want to see a full list of bands, you can see it &lt;a href="http://www.rheinkultur-festival.de/index.php?article_id=2&amp;amp;clang=0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I went with Christian, his friend Nils and his brother Titus and met up with Felix, Claudia, and Freddie.  &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2616/3690154720_4c80a16508_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 180px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2616/3690154720_4c80a16508_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Because the festival was free, the crowd was an incredibly colorful motley of people: parents with their baby carriages (no joke), teenagers, older people, punks, wiggas, skaters, hipsters, techno enthusiasts, etc.  Additionally, people were more willing to spend money on beer and food, as well as not staying for the entire length of the festival.  It was probably very good exposure for any of the bands that don't have a huge following and probably just plain fun for any of the more popular bands.  The only band I actually knew was No Use for a Name and we didn't actually stay for them since we needed to drive back to Düsseldorf.  For a free all-day music festival, I had a few observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, each stage was pretty much divided up into genre.  The blue stage was probably the most diverse with more mainstream hip-hop and some rock, the red stage mostly appealed to the alternative/punk crowd, the green stage was for jazz enthusiasts (I think...we didn't go), the &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2437/3690153212_5ba1672b05_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 262px; height: 196px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2437/3690153212_5ba1672b05_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"Tanzberg" was for techno junkies, and the last little stage was definitely for hip-hop and rap people.  Because the stages were divided, the types of people were also quite obviously divided through fashion.  For example, the techno stage had all half-naked people dancing around in some sort of trance, whereas the hip-hop stage was pretty much just a bunch of wiggas with their flat-visored baseball caps, oversized t-shirts, and low-hanging pants.  I don't want to just describe stereotypes, but really, that's what it was. Additionally, it was also funny because you could almost see or know what drugs were being taken at each stage.  The red stage's drug of choice was most likely just alcohol, perhaps with speed, the Tanzberg stage was most certainly ecstasy, and the little hip-hop stage was quite obviously weed.  Because the blue stage was the most diverse stage, you couldn't really say one particular group of people hung around there and therefore, the drugs there were also probably a mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another observation is the sheer number of parents that brought small children with them.  We definitely saw several baby carriages and parents carrying their kids in their arms.  Maybe a stupid question, but seriously, who brings babies and small children to music festivals?  I suppose the answer lies in the fact that it was free because otherwise, I would think no parent in their right mind would pay to bring a kid to a music festival.  However, despite the fact that it was free, I personally wouldn't want to schlep my kid all over the place on a hot day where there are lots of inebriates.  Not only that, I would think it would be tedious bringing a little person around from stage to stage.  At some point, I'm sure they will just say they've had enough and you certainly can't force a child to do something like you can force your friend (then again, some friends are like 5-year-olds anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3689351505_d9ddf14deb_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 180px; height: 240px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3689351505_d9ddf14deb_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and my last comment is about the picture above...In Germany, it's actually illegal to jaywalk/cross on red.  People will yell sometimes yell at me if I cross the street without waiting, especially if they are a) old people or b) parents with their children.  I've gotten old people yelling at me saying that young people are a disgrace to society.  With parents, I get that I'm a bad person because I cross and that the kid shouldn't follow what I do.  They shouldn't follow what I do anyway because I'm a stranger, though, right?  However, in Bonn, they have these signs all over the place: "Nur bei Grün den Kindern zum Vorbild."  A rough translation would be, "Only on green.  Be a role model for the children."  We were all laughing at this because, hey, don't cross on red because it's illegal, just don't cross on red because you should be a role model for kids.  These are the things when I think to myself, "Ha ha, I live in Germany.

I've gone to a whole bunch of concerts since living here, but it only occurred to me last night that Germans turn everything into a soccer game.  Well, I suppose they turn everything into a soccer game only if there is chanting and large groups of people involved.  Certain cheers don't really transfer well from the soccer field (err, football pitch?) to a concert environment.  For example, "Olé, olé, olé, olé, olé, olé."  I'm sure you've heard it if you've ever seen or been to a soccer game, but seriously, people.  How does that cheer work for a band??  It doesn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SfRtH9ZEXsI/AAAAAAAAAM4/pYPg_MvYlf4/s1600-h/IMG_8096.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SfRtH9ZEXsI/AAAAAAAAAM4/pYPg_MvYlf4/s200/IMG_8096.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5329004242592358082" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Additionally, Germans &lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;love&lt;/span&gt; to clap.  I may have mentioned this before, but they'll clap to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g&lt;/span&gt;.  Whether it's your "typical" German music, what's called Schlagermusik (here's a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9XKCeMvLns"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to an example and you can actually hear the clapping with it), pop music, or in the case of last night, punk, clapping can be heard.  Of course, they even clap in sync with each other at soccer games.  I don't know what it is, but clapping is everywhere except at the university.  Instead of clapping after a lecture is done, students knock on the desks.  But back to last night...sure, there are points when the band encourages clapping in sync to the beat, but then other songs where there really isn't a beat to clap to, Germans manage to somehow clap.  I've heard the excuse for this is that parents will clap out syllables for their kids to learn new words because German words are so long (like Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung, meaning speed limit, which is actually longer than the longest English word, antidisestablishmentarianism).  So, for the word meaning speed limit, they'll clap out "Ge-schwin-di-keits-be-gren-zung."  I'm not sure if that has to do with listening to punk music, but sure, why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was also funny about last night that doesn't necessarily have to do with soccer is the crowd itself.  It was so strange because every time the Living End &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SfRtX2-MDUI/AAAAAAAAANA/HhS2uYu7zSI/s1600-h/IMG_8110.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SfRtX2-MDUI/AAAAAAAAANA/HhS2uYu7zSI/s200/IMG_8110.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5329004515746909506" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;would finish a song, people would clap and cheer for about 5 to 10 seconds before stopping completely.  And then it'd be kind of quiet while everyone waited for the band to start the next song.  I thought this was a little awkward because almost every other I've been to, people will continue clapping and cheering until the next song starts or the band says something.  Even the lead singer/guitarist Chris mentioned it, saying the last time they were in Germany, the crowd was a little rowdier and noisier.  Funny enough, everyone booed to this comment (I cheered because I was glad that someone said it), but I wanted to say, people, it's your own fault!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this might have to do with the fact that Germans are ok with awkward silences.  I know as an American, it's kind of weird if you meet someone for the first time and then there's a lull in the conversation.  It's almost as if you're saying, "Well, we don't have much to say to each other, so that's why we've run out of things to say.  Therefore, we probably won't be great friends."  Or in the case of a date, you probably think you've run out of things to say and you're not compatible.  So as an American, I thought it was strange last night to have a break in cheering and clapping.  It was almost as if the crowd was saying, "You're good, but not good enough for me to keep showing my appreciation for you."  However, Germans are ok with awkward silences when you're talking to someone for the first time.  They don't really think anything of it.  I was thinking that perhaps the audience last night wasn't not appreciative, they just deemed it not necessary to have to exaggerate or anything like that (if that makes sense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;amp;photo_secret=49cbb4f62d&amp;amp;photo_id=3475235429"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;/param&gt; &lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;amp;photo_secret=49cbb4f62d&amp;amp;photo_id=3475235429" height="300" width="400"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;A video of The Living End rocking out. &lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it was improvised, but very awesome nonetheless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I've been here in Germany for almost 3.5 years, there are still things I will never quite get and will still laugh at.

Considering that Beijing had been hardcore culture and Hong Kong hardcore shopping with a touch of culture, Singapore was a week of relaxation and enjoying the sun (which we don't have too much of in the winter in Germany).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SetbW0ELw9I/AAAAAAAAAL0/IR05WeTu9gE/s1600-h/IMG_8040.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SetbW0ELw9I/AAAAAAAAAL0/IR05WeTu9gE/s200/IMG_8040.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5326451431787185106" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The last time I was in Singapore was in 2000 as a 15-year-old that didn't eat much besides typical American cuisine.  This time around, I was psyched to try (almost) everything.  I still don't eat seafood at all, but we went out with my aunt and uncle to get some Sri Lankan crab and other seafood for Christian.  I got some tofu and lamb instead which was also delicious.  One day we went out for lunch at a hawker market, which is very typical Singaporean.  It's pretty much like a an outdoor food court with a bunch of little food stalls serving various dishes between $3 Sing and $10 Sing (about 1.50€ and 5€).  I got some laksa, which is best described as a curry noodle bowl with a coconut milk based soup, but Christian, my aunt, uncle, and their friend Robert got a whole slew of other dishes: oyster omelet, crispy pork, some noodle dish, some sort of sandwich, and Singaporean shaved ice which is a hell of a lot brighter than American shaved ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SetbiIMUISI/AAAAAAAAAL8/7hZinKdowk8/s1600-h/IMG_8046.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SetbiIMUISI/AAAAAAAAAL8/7hZinKdowk8/s200/IMG_8046.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5326451626168557858" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Singaporean shaved ice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/Setbz5G-IVI/AAAAAAAAAME/D7jRaWfDpDo/s1600-h/IMG_8045.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/Setbz5G-IVI/AAAAAAAAAME/D7jRaWfDpDo/s200/IMG_8045.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5326451931357258066" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Some stalls at the hawker market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day we also went out for high tea at the Shangri-La Hotel.  I think I had been there 9 years ago on my second trip to Singapore, but again, I was more keen this time around to try different foods.  My aunt said that you could definitely see signs of the recession because the buffet there was scaled back a bit.  Additionally, there weren't very many people there in general, whereas a year or two ago, it would've been packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did some typical tourist things for Singapore: the Night Safari, &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SetcPkKB2_I/AAAAAAAAAMM/UtUKxhv3ajA/s1600-h/IMG_8056.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SetcPkKB2_I/AAAAAAAAAMM/UtUKxhv3ajA/s200/IMG_8056.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5326452406769277938" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;the Zoo, Jurong Bird Park, a day at the beach on Sentosa Island.  The Night Safari was probably a highlight because we saw tons of animals prowling around.  The last time I had been to the Night Safari was back in 1994 when it had just opened.  I remember Lannie and I were more fascinated by the geckos at the tram stations than any of the animals because a lot of the animals weren't actually visible (kind of like the dinosaurs on the dinosaur tour in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/span&gt;).  Fifteen years later, the Night Safari really has expanded a lot and there were animals everywhere.  I also really liked how they urge visitors to be mindful of wildlife and how they are trying to get people aware of threatened and endangered animals.  I think Jurong Bird Park also expanded in comparison to the first time we were there 15 years ago, and again, the park is done really well and for the most part, the animals have enough free range or run around free (er, fly around).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SetclyOUz2I/AAAAAAAAAMU/LGH39Y1pYSI/s1600-h/IMG_8065.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SetclyOUz2I/AAAAAAAAAMU/LGH39Y1pYSI/s200/IMG_8065.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5326452788502515554" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It was a nice week being able to relax and enjoy the sun and recharge our batteries.  We also did a little shopping (more like Christian did), went to the movies and saw &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Fanboys&lt;/span&gt;, and basically, enjoyed our last week of vacation.  Though it was my third time visiting, I still think I couldn't live in Singapore because of the climate.  It's still hot and humid and probably will always be and it's just not my favorite climate at all.  If you want to see more pictures from Singapore, you can see them as a &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee/sets/72157616065778978/"&gt;Flickr set here&lt;/a&gt;.

The first impression of Hong Kong&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNOJ9Bd-AI/AAAAAAAAAKs/hcmMkwDTwBk/s1600-h/IMG_7650.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 224px; height: 168px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNOJ9Bd-AI/AAAAAAAAAKs/hcmMkwDTwBk/s200/IMG_7650.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5324185117388568578" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was that it is definitely more westernized than Beijing and the people are more, well, sophisticated.  I got the feeling that the majority of women there only wear heels and rarely wear flats and definitely &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;not &lt;/span&gt;sneakers (even ones that might be considered "fashionable" like Converses).  Derek's guess was that the women are short and therefore feel like they need to compensate for their height deficiency.  Additionally, the women are just plain fashionable and I felt out of place in skinny jeans and a black t-shirt, which in most other places is just kind of neutral.  Not in Hong Kong.  The men there aren't noticeably different than in western countries, but in comparison to Beijing, men weren't spitting on the floor everywhere.  Lastly, in terms of sophistication, everyone there has the newest, sickest, most modern cell phones possible.  Christian and I thought that cell phones there are more of a status symbol than anywhere here in Germany.  The iPhone is everywhere and most likely all are cracked, but cell phone technology seemed more prevalent in HK than it did in Beijing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked Hong Kong because I felt like it was one of the &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNTO_KC19I/AAAAAAAAALs/DRNbD0HMmmo/s1600-h/IMG_7777.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNTO_KC19I/AAAAAAAAALs/DRNbD0HMmmo/s200/IMG_7777.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5324190701418895314" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;few places on Earth where I felt like I truly fit in, in terms of way of life.  It's this strange mix of Chinese and Western culture and the majority of Hong Kong people speak a mix of Cantonese and English.  So if I didn't know a word in Cantonese while speaking it, I just threw it out in English, but people didn't hesitate or give me a second look.  The attitude was more, "Sure, whatever, I get what you're saying."  For example, we got ice cream at Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's and I know how to say, "I want one..." but I didn't know how to read or say the flavor (coffee, coffee, buzz, buzz, buzz).  I just said, "Ngoh yiu yut goh coffee, coffee, buzz, buzz, buzz."  And it worked.  (And I apologize if my Romanization makes no sense to anyone who can actually read the Romanization of Cantonese.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNOh1WeUFI/AAAAAAAAAK0/upAdoMgqr7U/s1600-h/IMG_7698.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 229px; height: 171px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNOh1WeUFI/AAAAAAAAAK0/upAdoMgqr7U/s200/IMG_7698.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5324185527646048338" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;The symbol of Hong Kong at a flower show in Victoria Park&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Additionally, I started picking up words and phrases really quickly and making connections between things I had never done before.  For example, everywhere you go, there are warnings to &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNPnYSxksI/AAAAAAAAAK8/dwiQyCr4tWQ/s1600-h/IMG_7718.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNPnYSxksI/AAAAAAAAAK8/dwiQyCr4tWQ/s200/IMG_7718.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5324186722436747970" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;mind the gap, mind your head, mind the wet floor, etc.  In Cantonese, they just say "siu sum" which I always thought to mean "be careful," which it does.  However, translated literally, it means "little heart" and I hadn't associated the words "siu" with little and "sum" with heart (which is also the same "sum" as in "dim sum"), even though I know both "siu" and "sum."  I'm not sure if my explanation makes any sense whatsoever, but I've never thought about what "siu sum" literally meant.  I guess the best way to explain it is the word "Frühstück" for Germans.  It means breakfast, but the two words "früh" and "Stück" mean "early thing," but Germans never think of it as an "early thing," just as "breakfast."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of tourism, Hong Kong doesn't have nearly as many historical and &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNP-t5LzMI/AAAAAAAAALE/Gqaj93k2LsM/s1600-h/IMG_7771.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNP-t5LzMI/AAAAAAAAALE/Gqaj93k2LsM/s200/IMG_7771.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5324187123371986114" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;cultural sites as Beijing.  Notable things were the Victoria Peak (where all the British colonists went when the heat got unbearable because it's cooler there), the Tian Tan Buddha run by the Po Lin Monastery on Lantau Island, and some of old colonial buildings leftover from the British.  A lot of people say that the New York skyline is impressive and don't get me wrong, it is, but the Hong Kong skyline keeps on going for what seems like forever.  We went up to the Peak at night and the skyline is really a sight to see.  There aren't really words for it, so I'm just posting a picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNQdVSUMcI/AAAAAAAAALM/GRSDrr1AgbE/s1600-h/IMG_7852.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNQdVSUMcI/AAAAAAAAALM/GRSDrr1AgbE/s200/IMG_7852.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5324187649342452162" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We also went to HK Disneyland (which is also out on Lantau Island) for a day because I've been to the two in the U.S. and the one in Tokyo, so I figured, hey, I just need to go to Euro Disney and HK Disney to have been to all of them.  The park was rather small and we did it in a half day, but it was still fun and just nice to be able to not really do anything super intense.  I actually convinced Christian to ride Space Mountain (which is more modern than the Space Mountain in Orlando).  He doesn't like roller coasters at all and when we got off, his hands were shaking and he just kept saying, "Nope, I am NOT going on it again!"  HK Disneyland is definitely more for little kids than it is for people of all ages like Disneyworld in Orlando and I don't think I'd go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing to do in Hong Kong, however, is shopping.  Hong Kong people love to shop and an attestation to this is the copious amount of malls and stores.  We did a good amount of shopping ourselves in some outlets out in Tung Chung, around Causeway Bay, and the Times Square Bazaar.  When we went to the Times Square Bazaar, there was an outlet sale of Diane von Fürstenberg and Kate Spade stuff, so I got some really good deals on some DvF dresses.  However, there were these "bazaar" sales all over for HK.  We also went to one for "young fashion," where they had stuff like Miss Sixty and Carhartt (the fashionable stuff) for cheap.  If you ever go to Hong Kong, you just need to look out for signs for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNRZHztkuI/AAAAAAAAALU/ryq3pqYmC5Q/s1600-h/IMG_7880.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 247px; height: 184px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNRZHztkuI/AAAAAAAAALU/ryq3pqYmC5Q/s200/IMG_7880.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5324188676516582114" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;The Hong Kong skyline from Victoria Peak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNSlVOU6PI/AAAAAAAAALc/uitXZGjkDhc/s1600-h/IMG_7866.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNSlVOU6PI/AAAAAAAAALc/uitXZGjkDhc/s200/IMG_7866.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5324189985787930866" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The other thing to do in Hong Kong is eat.  We had dim sum a lot because it's not readily available here in Germany, plus it's fun just to see the carts go by and order what you want.  There were some restaurants where you have to order everything on a piece of paper and it'll be brought out, which for me was sometimes difficult because I can't read anything.  I know in one restaurant I told the waiter in Cantonese that I can't read Chinese and he laughed in his puzzlement.  That day, Christian was also sick and didn't eat anything, so I ate three little plates of the dim sum and 3/4 of a noodle dish by myself.  The same waiter proceeded to tell me he was super impressed about how much I ate and wondering why Christian wasn't eating.  He asked if he was a picky Westerner, to which I told him what was wrong.  And all in Cantonese.  Again, I was impressed about how much I could say and understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also went out to Macao (also spelled Macau) on our last day.  &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNS-0sW4VI/AAAAAAAAALk/eAEuBZcyLfo/s1600-h/IMG_7933.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SeNS-0sW4VI/AAAAAAAAALk/eAEuBZcyLfo/s200/IMG_7933.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5324190423732117842" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It was really crowded leaving HK and went by boat.  The ride was about an hour and once we got to Macao, we had to go through Macanese customs.  All I can say is: What a pain.  We waited in line for an hour and had to deal with mainland Chinese shoving everyone and getting into fights with the Hong Kongers about who was in line first, etc.  Once we got to the city, we went to see São Paulo's Cathedral (or the remains of it) and the old Portuguese fortress at the top of the hill.  But other than that, the only other thing to see in Macao are the casinos (useless for us since we don't gamble).  The city isn't exactly what I would say pretty.  There are corners where there is a clear mainland European influence as opposed to Hong Kong and everyone has a scooter like a Vespa, but really, Hong Kong is much better and more interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think all in all, Hong Kong is definitely a place where I can imagine living and definitely more so than Beijing.  It's a high-paced city like New York and we were lucky to have good weather.  It's not overly expensive (though in comparison to say, Berlin, it is), the quality of life is good, and it has a lot to offer for the people who live there.

Rather than detailing everything we did since that can be found on Wikipedia, I'm just going to write my impressions of each place.  In Beijing, we stayed with my friend Zach from college, which was really great since he was able to show us places where we wouldn't normally go and ordered very local dishes.  The first thing he actually did was give us a roll of toilet paper, saying, "First rule of living in Beijing: &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Always&lt;/span&gt; have a roll of toilet paper with you.  You're going to need it and you'll be grateful that you have it."  This wound up being very, very true and we were thankful that he had given us the tip.  Many of the public restrooms don't have toilet paper in them at all, even at some of the more touristy spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first day was mostly dealing with bureaucracy and getting the correct paperwork to register at the local police station, saying that we were residing with a friend for a week.  All visitors to China are required to do it, but if you stay at a hotel, the hotel usually does it for you.  Afterward, we walked around a little bit around his neighborhood where there are a lot of embassies, as well as Russian businesses.  It was interesting because where he lives is almost like Little Russia; the Russians are the biggest minority in Beijing and all of their businesses have Cyrillic writing on them.  We decided to take the first day easy since we were jet lagged, but it was also good just to get a sense of what the city is like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SdicYOXzvXI/AAAAAAAAAJs/-5XE7vUvMSw/s1600-h/IMG_7251.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SdicYOXzvXI/AAAAAAAAAJs/-5XE7vUvMSw/s200/IMG_7251.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5321174899726990706" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The next day, we woke up early and went out to get breakfast with Zach.  He got us these things called "jian bang," which was a crepe-like thing with (maybe) hoisin and a spicy sauce on it, a crunchy bread thing, an egg, some sort of seeds, and cilantro all freshly made and wrapped up for a mere 6 RMB for the two of us, about 0.60€.  It was so delicious and cheap that we ate this almost every morning and realized that Zach was right: eating out in China is so cheap that it's not worth it to cook for yourself.  The three of us could go out and eat a full, well-made meal for about 100 RMB (about 10.80€) and that would be considered on the expensive side.  Most of the time when we ate with Zach, it definitely cost less than 100 kuai (that's like saying "bucks" or "quid" in China) and we of course had no qualms about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlight of being in Beijing was probably Wednesday when &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/Sdisq-JcrsI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/iiUFndCvwR8/s1600-h/IMG_7357.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/Sdisq-JcrsI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/iiUFndCvwR8/s200/IMG_7357.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5321192813975350978" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;we went on a hiking tour with the &lt;a href="http://www.beijinghikers.com/"&gt;Beijing Hikers&lt;/a&gt; to the Great Wall, Jiankou to Mutianyu.  Zach works for the company and suggested we do it, even if the tour was rated a level 4 (more difficult).  I had brought my running sneakers for the occasion, and man, was I glad!  We started out in a small village, hiked up the side of a mountain (or extraordinarily steep hill) where we had some great views of the surrounding area, and finally reached the Great Wall that was about 1100 meters above sea level.  The part of the Wall where we began was completely unrestored, overgrown, and wild with trees and grass poking up between the crumbling bricks.  After taking a break at a lookout, we hiked along the Wall &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SdjO-bvngpI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/2yuHE-Er4ww/s1600-h/IMG_7366.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 121px; height: 162px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SdjO-bvngpI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/2yuHE-Er4ww/s200/IMG_7366.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5321230531732931218" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;to a part called Ox Horn's Ridge that was super steep, almost a 90º angle, then had to climb down the ridge.  To say the least, it was good that we had hiking sticks from the Beijing Hikers, though they weren't much use on the way down because the steps were worn away and it was more helpful grabbing onto sides of the crumbling Wall (I slipped and fell on my butt).  At some point, we finally reached a restored part of the Wall called Mutianyu which made things a lot easier, though there were still tons of stairs to climb down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SdjPNSvkNwI/AAAAAAAAAKE/ldJ8bs1xR-g/s1600-h/IMG_7388.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SdjPNSvkNwI/AAAAAAAAAKE/ldJ8bs1xR-g/s200/IMG_7388.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5321230787014833922" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Along the restored parts, there were locals selling drinks to tourists, consistently asking, "Beer?  Coke?  You want drink?"  One man stopped us, asking where we were from, and Zach, as tour guide, conversed with him.  The old man asked specifically where Christian's from and laughed upon finding out he is German.  He said that Christian looked too "stupid" ("saw" in Chinese) to be American like the rest of us there at the moment because he didn't look like he would vote for Bush.  It turned out that the old man was a Bush supporter because he believed Bush did a lot of good things for China, whereas Obama wouldn't be good for the country.  So to him, Christian didn't look smart enough to vote for Bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the 12 kilometer (8 mile) hike, our legs were tired and we were hungry for lunch.  Everyone paid to take the tobaggan down the mountain, which was super fun.  I tried to make a video of part of the way down, but at the same time, I didn't want to be so involved making the video that I would miss the ride.  Afterwards, we took a short bus ride to a small restaurant still in the countryside where we had everything pre-ordered for us.  Though the restaurant was outside and very unassuming, the food was great (not to mentioned included in the price of the tour).  I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Beijing to do a hike with the Beijing Hikers because it was something we wouldn't do normally and we saw things we wouldn't have seen otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object width="239" height="198" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-630f8a05162bb42c" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"&gt;&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D630f8a05162bb42c%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1465117636%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D1CF88C550EC1FC865BBDAF90A756EA84EDB7FAFA.8E00D6CA9F659145DFEF623636B5BE3F99E11B82%26key%3Dck2&amp;amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D630f8a05162bb42c%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3Dy-lRmMzMXmuGWu3Lf5nU3ukHkbk&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;ps=blogger"&gt;&lt;embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="239" height="198" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D630f8a05162bb42c%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1465117636%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D1CF88C550EC1FC865BBDAF90A756EA84EDB7FAFA.8E00D6CA9F659145DFEF623636B5BE3F99E11B82%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D630f8a05162bb42c%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3Dy-lRmMzMXmuGWu3Lf5nU3ukHkbk&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, Beijing is at times a modern time city where it's a free-for-all with traffic, but at the same time, still sort of backwards.  Then again, "backwards" is a bit subjective. For example, I had been told that little kids run around with slits in their pants so that they can urinate and defecate easily in the street when necessary.  I thought this couldn't be true, but we saw this in action at the Summer Palace when a little boy with said slit was allowed to pee on a tree in the middle of the path.  Additionally, squat toilets are common, which I have no problem with.  It's when there is no privacy between the holes in the ground that's problematic.  Even worse is when there are stalls with doors on them and then women pay no regard to the doors, squatting down and going.  I was appalled that this actually happened, but their attitude towards this sort of privacy is completely indifferent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beijing is also very polluted and we were lucky to have good weather while there.  There were one or two days when we couldn't see buildings in front of us because of the smog, &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SdjQvW5UYpI/AAAAAAAAAKM/HwCffXoJR2I/s1600-h/IMG_7477.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SdjQvW5UYpI/AAAAAAAAAKM/HwCffXoJR2I/s200/IMG_7477.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5321232471756661394" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;but when we looked directly up, the sky was blue.  The day we went to the Forbidden City was incredibly windy, which made visibility very clear, but also the day was really, really cold.  I got a bit of a sore throat from the air, as well as a rash from the undrinkable water.  Though it sounds much worse than it really was, it's apparently normal when people move to Beijing and get a throat infection within the first month of living there.  All in all, however, the city was definitely incredible to visit and there is so much cultural stuff to see.  The food was great and cheap, the people friendly (though they tended to laugh once they figured out I couldn't speak Mandarin), the public transportation easy, and in general, the city was also cheap by western standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as I said earlier and because people often say that a picture is worth a thousand words, you can check out the 365 pictures from Beijing I took as a set on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee/sets/72157616021793622/"&gt;Flickr account&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='enclosure' type='video/mp4' href='http://www.blogger.com/video-play.mp4?contentId=630f8a05162bb42c&amp;type=video%2Fmp4' length='0'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/7340341043041601375/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=7340341043041601375&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7340341043041601375'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7340341043041601375'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/04/asia-trip-week-1-beijing-china.html' title='Asia Trip Week 1: Beijing, China'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SdicYOXzvXI/AAAAAAAAAJs/-5XE7vUvMSw/s72-c/IMG_7251.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-5967088317036176529</id><published>2009-03-01T17:57:00.006+01:00</published><updated>2009-03-01T20:22:26.942+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Wetten, Dass...The Ultimate TV Show</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SarfOrT7AmI/AAAAAAAAAJc/4sMXFVMlVL0/s1600-h/IMG_7185.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SarfOrT7AmI/AAAAAAAAAJc/4sMXFVMlVL0/s200/IMG_7185.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5308300554046997090" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Anyone who's ever talked to me about German television has heard of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wetten, dass&lt;/span&gt;...  You can read about the first time I saw it &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2005/12/final-draw-wm-2006wetten-dass.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Long story short: It's this crazy show with weird talents that celebrities bet on and it's on once a month.  It's also the most popular TV show in German speaking countries here in Europe.  I've been applying to get tickets for the show ever since I got back to Germany with the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Program, even if the show was being taped in cities like Mannheim or Leipzig, where I have no connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got tickets for last night's show here in Düsseldorf, where the guests were Jennifer Aniston &amp;amp; Owen Wilson promoting &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Marley &amp;amp; Me&lt;/span&gt;, Boris Becker and on-and-off-girlfriend Lilly Kerssenberger, the Oscar winner for best animated short Jochen Alexander Freydank, and German actors Heike Makatsch, Andrea Sawatzki, and Heino Ferch.  The musical guests were some band called Reamonn, German comedian Hape Kerkeling as his (female) singer-character Uschi Blum, Duffy, and Oasis.  Christian and I had seats in the third from last row, but I was nonetheless super excited to be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SarewH1vZcI/AAAAAAAAAJU/IiL5w8f1Iy0/s1600-h/IMG_7197.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SarewH1vZcI/AAAAAAAAAJU/IiL5w8f1Iy0/s200/IMG_7197.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5308300029129090498" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first bet was a woman who said she could recognize which of her 30 dogs was drinking from a bowl solely from the noise the dog makes when drinking.  She only had to name five dogs, but Owen Wilson said she wouldn't be able to do it.  Because she could, he had to eat a dog biscuit and split it with Jennifer Aniston.  She kept insisting, "But I said she could do it!" Host Thomas Gottschalk's reply was simply, "Well, you're a team, so too bad, you have to eat the half."  Only on German television could you get an American celebrity to do something like that!  The entire time that the two were there, Jennifer Aniston kept looking around in disbelief (like the most American celebrities do when on &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wetten, dass...&lt;/span&gt;)  At one point, Thomas Gottschalk actually just said to her, "See?  This is what we do on German television...every week!"  To say the least, she looked shocked, confused, and in disbelief.  It was pretty amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlight of the night had to definitely be the Außenwette (outside bet), which was held on one of the runways at the Düsseldorf Airport.  The bet was that while a man rode his motorcycle on the back wheel, his partner could change the front tire.  I've been watching the show for about three years and I have to say, this had to be the best outdoor bet that I've ever seen.  Check out the video:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="221" width="360"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Y6QJDx1zOv8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Y6QJDx1zOv8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="221" width="360"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motorcycle weighed around 400 kilograms if I recall correctly and to say the least, definitely one of the most dangerous bets I've ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see the highlights of the show, you can go to the&lt;a href="http://www.wettendass.zdf.de/"&gt; ZDF &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wetten, dass..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. site.  The show lasted three hours, though it's usually only scheduled for two.  It was certainly a good time, but considering the cost of the tickets (30€ per person) how early we had to get to the Messe where they were taping and then the show time itself, I don't think I would go again.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/5967088317036176529/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=5967088317036176529&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5967088317036176529'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5967088317036176529'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/03/wetten-dassthe-ultimate-tv-show.html' title='Wetten, Dass...The Ultimate TV Show'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SarfOrT7AmI/AAAAAAAAAJc/4sMXFVMlVL0/s72-c/IMG_7185.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-4022129602748360311</id><published>2009-02-23T17:24:00.006+01:00</published><updated>2009-02-23T19:08:13.097+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Karneval: Round 3</title><content type='html'>In a way, holidays are a good way of keeping track of how long I've lived here in Germany.  This past weekend was my third Karneval, though admittedly I don't think &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2006/03/karneval-prague.html"&gt;my first one&lt;/a&gt; will ever be topped.  I also finally bought a costume (flight attendant), so I guess it will be my costume for years to come if I end up staying here in the area longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say the least, Karneval has certainly lost its appeal to me.  It's not as exciting as it was the first time around and in fact, I actually think it's really stressful having to get dressed up and party for five days straight.  (I guess this is perhaps a sign of getting older, as well.)  &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SaLiQVE-u3I/AAAAAAAAAJI/Jx8p5n5oDAk/s1600-h/IMG_7161.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SaLiQVE-u3I/AAAAAAAAAJI/Jx8p5n5oDAk/s200/IMG_7161.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5306052081159682930" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Oddly enough, I still don't know any songs except for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Viva Colonia&lt;/span&gt;, which is actually only sung in Köln.  It'd be practically blasphemous to play that here in Düsseldorf (imagine someone screaming about how great the Yankees are in front of Fenway Park in Boston when the Yankees aren't playing).  However, it's nice now that I actually live here because if I get fed up with the drunken costumed crowds, I can come home by myself and be left in peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I didn't really celebrate Karneval last year, I have definitely noticed a change between my first one and this year.  Some of our friends, Christian, and I stood at the same Platz that we did three years ago, but it was much quieter this year.  There wasn't nearly as much singing and there weren't any speakers blasting traditional Karneval music.  As a joke, I said, "Ha, it might be due to the recession," but then I thought about it, and perhaps that really &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a reason.  In Germany, if you want to play music in a public space (ie: a club, in the street), you actually have to pay for the rights to the music.  If you don't, you may end up paying huge fines.  I'm not exactly sure how the law works and how they check it, but I could imagine that with the economy the way it is, whoever usually sponsors the music might not have been able to afford it this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another difference is attitudes towards American politics.  Three years ago, we were in the middle of President Bush's second term and to say the least, he was not seen in a positive light.  Here's a picture from 3 years ago that I also posted on my first blog entry about Karneval:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/36/108133269_e2e63cbb50.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 269px; height: 201px;" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/36/108133269_e2e63cbb50.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As you can see, President Bush is depicted as an ape holding a sign that says "Evolution ist eine Irrlehre," or "Evolution is heresy."  Obviously, this was making fun of Bush's association with the religious movement in the U.S. and the desire to teach creationism in our public schools.  It doesn't help that Bush is shown as something that hasn't evolved.  (As a disclaimer, this does not reflect my political views whatsoever, I'm just giving my analysis of it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, I wasn't expecting anything different.  I was actually thinking that there would be a float mocking Obama, whether for his appointment choices and the tax problems that his appointees have had, or for the stimulus package.  To be honest, that's probably a little too deep into American politics, but I wasn't disappointed; this float was in the parade:&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SaLZPUUMadI/AAAAAAAAAI4/deoOtVLUsmM/s1600-h/IMG_7169.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 236px; height: 177px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SaLZPUUMadI/AAAAAAAAAI4/deoOtVLUsmM/s200/IMG_7169.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5306042168170539474" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference, right?  I mean, Obama as an angel with his campaign slogan written on the wings?!  Not to mention that there was a smaller angel with the EU flag on it behind Obama with the words, "We too!" on it  (You can see a picture of that &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sannielee/3303385669/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  It's as if we're being welcomed back to the world with Obama as our president.  But Obama as an angel?  I suppose one could say that I'm looking way too much into the meaning of these floats, and I do realize they are supposed to be satirical, but I feel like there is always some truth to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the less analytical side of Karneval, it was more interesting this year because I know more people than the past two years I've celebrated.  And when I say "more people," I mean Germans who have celebrated Karneval since their births.  It wasn't as if I was an outsider observing this tradition; &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SaLhnV2rUBI/AAAAAAAAAJA/7l1rMCopbUI/s1600-h/IMG_7144.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 244px; height: 183px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SaLhnV2rUBI/AAAAAAAAAJA/7l1rMCopbUI/s200/IMG_7144.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5306051376993488914" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was actually there to celebrate with everyone.  Though I do have to say it was pretty funny on Thursday night when I went out with Christian and his friends and one of my friends, Alison.  Alison had the same flight attendant costume as I did, but just in a different color.  We had decided independently that we wanted to be flight attendants, but we got the costumes together.  Anyway, it's also really funny because Alison is Filipino by heritage and she's from a town only 15 minutes away from my hometown.  When we were in this club/bar, there were guys coming up to us thinking we were alone and trying out pick up lines like, "I like Singapore Airlines!" and "I've been to Hong Kong; it was a great city."  It's like, "Uhh, ok, great?"  It certainly looked like we were by ourselves since we were dressed up the same and we're both Asian, but honestly, what kind of pick-up lines are those?  Oh well.  Unfortunately I didn't have my camera on me to take a picture of Alison &amp;amp; me as flight attendants, but I think Alison had her camera, so maybe I'll get the picture from her.  But back to the pick-up lines, I guess I will never escape cheesy lines like that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see all my Karneval pictures from this year, you can see them &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sannielee/sets/72157614260470269/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/4022129602748360311/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=4022129602748360311&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4022129602748360311'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4022129602748360311'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/02/karneval-round-3.html' title='Karneval: Round 3'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SaLiQVE-u3I/AAAAAAAAAJI/Jx8p5n5oDAk/s72-c/IMG_7161.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-6391815103717697978</id><published>2009-01-14T15:52:00.005+01:00</published><updated>2009-01-14T17:01:13.807+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Germany &amp; Minorities</title><content type='html'>With Barack Obama's election in November, many Europeans are asking themselves if their own countries could ever have a minority in the same position.  NPR is doing a series on this European self-reflection featuring countries like France, Italy, and Germany.  You can read or listen to the story about German minorities &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99189265"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which I would also like to add my insight from my own experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One person featured in the story, the son of a German mother and an African-American father, said, "White Germans do not perceive themselves as racist at all. The idea is there are no other races in Germany. Germany is a monoracial country so we can't be racist..."  To a point, I have to agree with this comment.  Germans really don't perceive themselves as racist and do not quite understand the concept of "cultural (in)sensitivity" the way Americans do.  The events of World War II have created an attitude of atonement, accepting what happened, and trying to come to terms with it.  Perhaps this is why Germans do not see what is racist; they see what happened in the past and that they are trying to learn from it.  This is all with the best intentions in mind, but perhaps this is why Germans "do not perceive themselves as racist."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another comment is from the son of a German woman and an exchange student from Cameroon, who was born in Leipzig when the East was under Communist rule.  He speaks of "&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;rassenschande&lt;/span&gt;" or shame of race, and how "having relations with nonwhites — and particularly with blacks — was taboo and considered shameful to a woman's entire family."  The story also mentions how "since the fall of communism, an outbreak of racist violence in the former East Germany has made it an area that's too dangerous for minorities, so Eichler won't let his children take school trips there."  Luckily, I have not encountered any such problems while I was in Dresden, Leipzig, Weimar, Potsdam, or Berlin, though I can understand the fear of being in the East.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to biracial relationships, I can personally say that I haven't had any problems or encountered raised eyebrows.  This &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;could&lt;/span&gt; be due to the fact that I am Asian-American, the keyword perhaps being "American" and living in the west.  However, I have seen other biracial couples here in Düsseldorf, many of them German men with Japanese women.  (There are a lot of Japanese here.)  I wonder if the stereotype of Asians being hardworking and college-educated has to do with this more accepting attitude of these biracial relationships, or if it has to do with the fact that it's western Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a lack of exposure to other cultures and thus a cultural sensitivity is not learned at school.  When I look at Christian's high school yearbook, there are two Korean students (siblings, nonetheless) and perhaps one or two students from Russia, whose names make it obvious that they are not German.  I know that as a kid in a very white, mostly Russian-Jewish/Italian-Catholic school, I was taunted with comments like "ching chong ching!" and "Chinese, Japanese, look at these!"  I also remember one student slinting his eyes at me in the fifth grade and I went to a teacher visibly upset, who promptly scolded him and told him why that was not acceptable.  I'm not so sure this would happen in schools here; the minorities probably just stick together or are invisible.  Not only that, most of the teachers are probably German and probably have never dealt with many minorities either, so they themselves don't get P.C.-ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't speak for the entire U.S. because I'm sure there are places that are not as diverse as my schools were, but I learned being P.C. at a very early age.  I know I had to tell Christian once or twice why he upset me with his un-P.C. comments about Asians (mostly regarding the infantile comments about what Asian languages sound like), but the vast majority of Germans don't have someone telling them things like that.  I have had to explain black face to Germans and why Americans think it inappropriate (yes, it has to do with our history, but honestly, people painting themselves a different color to represent someone of a different race to me is just an absurd idea, especially when it's done to caricature) and they just don't understand why.  During Karneval, I have seen people dress up as "Africans," "Mexicans," and "Asians."  I put these terms in quotations because they are stereotypes: the "Africans" will wear black-face and outfits that look like they were made out of some sort of animal skin or plant, "Mexicans" are normally a Mariachi band caricature, sometimes with skin painted brown, and "Asians" with vague Asian clothing and makeup to make them "slantier" eyes.  It never ceases to appall me, but Germans see it as being all in good fun and don't really mean anything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a slightly different note, the German-Cameroonian mentioned the often asked, "Where are you from?" and the unspoken "When are you going back?"  The question "Where are you from?" is also often asked of me in the U.S., and people aren't looking for my answer (New Jersey), rather they should be asking the more fitting, "What is your heritage?" or "Where is your family from?"  My first question there would be does that mean people are racist in the U.S.?  For me, I just think people need to learn how to phrase their question properly.  Here in Germany, people often ask me "Where are you from?" as a "What is your heritage?" question as well and I have had people &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; believe me that I'm American.  They think that I obviously must be from an Asian country.  How can I be American?  I am not your white nor black American, and those are the only two types of Americans that exist for these people.  For these people, understanding that people can be American and not white or black is something they have never considered.  Extending this idea to German minorities seems impossible if they can't accept American minorities, doesn't it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the question is if Germany will ever be able to elect a minority to chancellor like how the U.S. elected Obama president.  My answer: Not in the near future.  Racism here is sometimes subtle and sometimes not, but regardless, I really don't see a Turk becoming chancellor in the near-future.  There is still even a divide between West Germans and East Germans (Angela Merkel being the first East German elected chancellor).  When they can't figure out Germans from Germans, how are they supposed to figure out minorities too?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/6391815103717697978/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=6391815103717697978&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/6391815103717697978'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/6391815103717697978'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/01/germany-minorities.html' title='Germany &amp; Minorities'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-1243573129132329401</id><published>2009-01-05T16:30:00.008+01:00</published><updated>2009-01-05T17:07:54.897+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Happy 2009!</title><content type='html'>Happy New Year 2009!  This was my third Silvester spent here in Germany and it never seems to get old being able to set off fireworks in the city.  Christian and I went to Bonn, where his friend Felix and his girlfriend Claudia had a party.  It was a small, intimate party where we did raclette for dinner (I ate something like 10 potatoes).  Due to my eating tons, I was good to go in terms of alcohol, but also I didn't want to drink too much since we drove back to Düsseldorf.  (Christian didn't drink anything and drove, but I hate being in cars with a ton of alcohol in my system.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I mostly wanted to blog about was that I finally partook in "Bleigießen," literally "lead casting."  It's not actually lead that we cast, but some other sort of cheap metal.  It's tradition on New Year's to melt lead (or rather, this cheap metal), then drop the liquid quickly into water.  You take the lump of lead (cheap metal) out of the water, examine the shape and its shadow, and using your imagination, determine what it looks like.  There's a little booklet with possibilities in it and according to what you think it is, that determines what your year will be like.  Obviously it's probably as accurate as a horoscope, but nonetheless, it was a lot of fun.  I had always heard of "Bleigießen" but I had never done it before this year.  It was also amusing because nobody could decide if we had to do it before or after midnight.  Here are some pictures of the Bleigießen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SWIrn9hD-qI/AAAAAAAAAIA/oO0YFz4xSfc/s1600-h/IMG_7083.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SWIrn9hD-qI/AAAAAAAAAIA/oO0YFz4xSfc/s200/IMG_7083.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287836878014511778" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is Felix melting his little metal piece over a candle.  Mine for some reason seemed to take forever to melt, though there were some others who took longer.  At first, everyone was joking that the American couldn't do it correctly and hence the taking forever.  Once other people started having difficulties, they didn't say nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claudia is in the background probably examining someone else's piece of metal.  We decided to do the Bleigießen after midnight once we got back from setting off fireworks on the Rhein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SWIsvsX4XPI/AAAAAAAAAII/CMGJaW0_JmA/s1600-h/IMG_7090.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SWIsvsX4XPI/AAAAAAAAAII/CMGJaW0_JmA/s200/IMG_7090.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287838110363180274" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here's me with the finished metal after I melted it and threw it into the cold water.  I personally thought it looked like a drumstick from KFC or perhaps a jellyfish.  To be honest, I don't remember what we decided it was.  Not that that was super important because it's just for fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then here are some pictures from setting off fireworks on the Rhein:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SWItyxQQ7MI/AAAAAAAAAIY/NU-fPgjTtL4/s1600-h/IMG_7049.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SWItyxQQ7MI/AAAAAAAAAIY/NU-fPgjTtL4/s200/IMG_7049.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287839262724648130" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Agnes, Nils, &amp;amp; Grischa look at the firework we set off.  Grischa bought a whole pack of fireworks for 6.99€ at the supermarket.  Usually supermarkets start selling them right before Christmas and they're up front next to the cash register.  I'm not sure if there's an age restriction, but yeah, you can set off fireworks anywhere in the city, though it seemed like the majority of people were on the riverbank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SWIu9JNvb2I/AAAAAAAAAIg/b0tCvSE6wg0/s1600-h/IMG_7057.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SWIu9JNvb2I/AAAAAAAAAIg/b0tCvSE6wg0/s200/IMG_7057.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287840540466835298" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;None of these fireworks are professional.  They're all set off by people.  And admittedly, most of them are probably drunk.  What I find surprising is that not many things seem to get burned down, nor are there many injuries.  Granted, you have to be smart about it, but I think because Germans are used to setting off fireworks in the city every new year's, it's not much of a challenge for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SWIveXW333I/AAAAAAAAAIo/XkDGdyRgCSQ/s1600-h/IMG_7064.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SWIveXW333I/AAAAAAAAAIo/XkDGdyRgCSQ/s200/IMG_7064.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287841111198916466" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here's one of the few pictures that Christian and I took together.  We hadn't bought any of our own fireworks, but it wasn't necessary since Grischa and Felix had a bunch.  It was kind of cold going outside, but it's not as bad as the time I went to Times Square and waited hours in the cold.  What we did was nice and we spent about 45 minutes to an hour outside, which was bearable, but nonetheless it was a relief to get back inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, not much else is going on over here in Germany.  I start training for teaching English at Berlitz on January 19th and hopefully I'll be able to get some hours working as a freelancer.  I need money and something to do.  But other than finding a job, my new year's resolution this year is to keep in better touch with people and if that requires me calling people, well, so be it.  I realized nobody ever calls me, so I have to call everyone else.  So is life.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/1243573129132329401/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=1243573129132329401&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1243573129132329401'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1243573129132329401'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/01/happy-2009.html' title='Happy 2009!'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SWIrn9hD-qI/AAAAAAAAAIA/oO0YFz4xSfc/s72-c/IMG_7083.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-9202163649494984463</id><published>2008-11-25T23:39:00.005+01:00</published><updated>2008-11-26T00:14:42.215+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Change is in the Air</title><content type='html'>Continuing what I mentioned in my previous post that it seems that Europeans were excited to fly back to the U.S., I have to say, I'm surprised at Obama's presence everywhere. While I was on the subway, a homeless (black) man got on and basically said this: "OBAMA!  I am a Vietnam Vet!  Hey, you're gorgeous!  OBAMA!  Can you spare some change?  Change, yeah, ha ha!  Obama!"  That's a new way of getting money, I suppose.  However, here are some visual examples that I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSx_TsLjYXI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/KDBeOiSVX4o/s1600-h/IMG_6985.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 141px; height: 188px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSx_TsLjYXI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/KDBeOiSVX4o/s200/IMG_6985.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272729239997866354" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tracie and I ate at this restaurant yesterday.  As you can see, there is an Obama '08 sign in the window.  I've noticed that many businesses actually have similar displays of support like this.  When I visited Tracie at her Brooklyn apartment on Saturday, many barber shops that I passed by proudly displayed their Obama signs.  There was one shop that had a poster that said "American Heroes" or something like that as a headline and then a picture of JFK and Martin Luther King, Jr. with Obama's picture bigger than either.  The comparison was clear.&lt;br /&gt;Driving into Manhattan using the Holland Tunnel, there was an unmissable large Obama/Biden '08 billboard on Route 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSyAq424y9I/AAAAAAAAAHY/6pSAT38EmDo/s1600-h/IMG_6986.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSyAq424y9I/AAAAAAAAAHY/6pSAT38EmDo/s200/IMG_6986.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272730738049469394" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I took this picture on Grant Street in SoHo.  Unfortunately, I didn't actually look at what they were selling, but I'm pretty sure it was t-shirts and stuff.  (Fashionable, of course)  You can sort of see some merchandise through the window where Obama's neck is.  Tracie told me that a store nearby had been selling mugs during the election season and keeping a tally of how many McCain/Palin and Obama/Biden mugs were sold.  She said the McCain/Palin ones totaled perhaps 10, while the Obama/Biden ones filled the window tally and actually extended elsewhere in the store.  I feel like Obama has become a recognizable icon whose face will appear on shirts like Che Guevara.  Political fashion icon?  Perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSyCnOMwM7I/AAAAAAAAAHg/OUw1tDi0deQ/s1600-h/IMG_6988.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSyCnOMwM7I/AAAAAAAAAHg/OUw1tDi0deQ/s200/IMG_6988.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272732874082104242" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I saw this children's book about Barack Obama at my local Barnes &amp;amp; Noble while shopping with my dad.  All I could think was, "&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Seriously&lt;/span&gt;?"  The title is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Barack Obama, Son of Promise, Child of Hope&lt;/span&gt; and the opening page basically told of his biracial heritage.  Now, I think it's great that the book wants to talk about biracial families, but a children's book about Barack Obama?  Don't get me wrong, I supported the senator, but I thought that this was a bit much.  Granted, I didn't read through the entire book, but I couldn't get past the fact that it's a biography for children.  The man hasn't even become president yet and still has a lot in front of him.  Yes, he has achieved a lot and yes, he is inspiring, but couldn't we wait for a book like that to come out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to something I discussed with my friend Zach, whose French roommate asked him if he thought it was strange that the US is the only country where people will wear clothing with their presidential pick on clothing.  It's a good point, but I think I've also become a little German in this sense.  I question whether or not it's a good thing that people are so zealous about a political figure.  Part of my questioning is also due to the fact that I'm reading &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Shock Doctrine&lt;/span&gt; by Naomi Klein right now and I feel like it's making me paranoid about everything.  However, I am also excited about Obama's presidency; I think he has some fantastic ideas and I think it's great how he wants to use the internet as a means of accessibility.  The past 8 years have not been very good for the U.S. or its image abroad and Obama's presidency definitely symbolizes a change in direction.  I am eager to see what he will do and what he will achieve, but I also have reservations about what will actually happen.  Call me a pessimist, call me a realist, call me what you like, but that's just how I see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a completely non-political note, what's up with Uggs??  I know I wrote about them before and how much I &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;really, really, really&lt;/span&gt; despise/hate/loathe them, but yesterday I went shopping with my dad and there were waaaaay too many people buying them or wearing them.  They're so fugly.  Why would anyone wear them?  If you have an answer, please, do explain.

If you haven't heard of them before, they're a two-person band whose song "That's Not My Name" is a huge hit in Germany.  It's a pretty catchy song and their debut album is a lot of fun, so I thought it would be great to see them live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I thought the gig was (musically) disappointing.  The night started off well and the crowd was pumped up and dancing, which is always great.  However, as the short 45-minute set went on, I began to take notice little things that made me go "Huh?"  At times, I wasn't sure if Katie White, the singer, could actually play guitar.  I don't think she can, not well, anyway.  Then there were points where there were definitely filler tracks.  I always find &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SR9SUQclSmI/AAAAAAAAAHI/OQe4QuxIuiI/s1600-h/IMG_6948.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 230px; height: 172px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SR9SUQclSmI/AAAAAAAAAHI/OQe4QuxIuiI/s200/IMG_6948.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5269020597012482658" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;filler tracks a letdown, especially when it comes to rock shows.  The point of going to see a band live is to see how they perform and hear the songs differently.  Sure, fillers at a pop concert are ok (like Madonna, who for the most part is dancing around frantically on stage), but at an indie rock show?  Sure, the band only consists of two people, but the White Stripes are also only 2 people and they are simply amazing live.  Plus, they don't use pre-recorded stuff and their songs sound completely different than what's on the album.  To say the least, my enthusiasm for The Ting-Tings waned throughout the evening.  I knew the setlist would be short since they only have one album, but they did not play all that well (again, my problem is the filler tracks).  If the set was short and rocked, I would've been more impressed.  My verdict:  Don't go see The Ting-Tings live for more than 20€ until A. they come out with another album or B. they stop using filler track.  However, if you're just looking for a great time to dance to a live band and don't mind spending the money, then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday I flew back home to New Jersey, where I'm currently writing this entry.  My flight from Düsseldorf to Amsterdam was late, so I had to run through Schipol Airport to catch my connecting flight.  Luckily, I got to the gate as it was closing.  On the plane, I noticed that most of the other passengers were Europeans, but they were chattering the entire time about how great it was to be able to fly to America.  In comparison to my flight back to the States in July, I thought people were actually &lt;span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"&gt;excited&lt;/span&gt; to fly to the U.S.  I'm not exactly sure why this was the case, but I have a pretty good guess that it has to do with Obama's election last week.  Every weekly news magazine and several gossip magazines (like the equivalents of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;People&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Us Weekly&lt;/span&gt;) had the president-elect or him and his family on the cover.  There were several special editions about him.  And Europeans &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;love&lt;/span&gt; Barack Obama.  It's almost as if they were saying, "Welcome back to the world, America!"  The plane definitely had a more positive energy about it.  Another reason for it could be that I flew on a KLM/operated by Northwest flight, whereas in July I flew Lufthansa (whom I despise).  Who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being back home is still strange, especially because I know I'm here for only such a short time.  Cars are big, there's no poo shelf in the toilet (hooray!), I noticed the Jersey accent much more than before, and people are louder.

This is the first year that I've been a fervent supporter of any candidate.  It was the first time I contributed money a campaign, despite the fact that I have very little money to begin with (still unemployed) and I joined the Democrats Abroad and helped them register Americans living here to vote.  It was fantastic meeting the different types of people living in Germany and seeing how this election inspired so many people.  One man I met had been living abroad for 20 years or more and hadn't voted since he left the U.S., but he thought the presidential election was too important that he couldn't not vote.  There were several people my age that just had no idea how to get an absentee ballot.  Then there were Germans who were just amazed at the fact that there were Americans here trying to get the vote out, regardless of party association.  (We registered people as a non-partisan act, but if asked, we would respond that we were part of the Dems Abroad.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the last three weeks before Election Day, I could be found obsessively checking polls, the NY Times, Washington Post, Fox News, and YouTube.  &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/01/us/politics/01angst.html?partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink"&gt;This NY Times article&lt;/a&gt; described me perfectly.  Leading up the election, I was also interviewed by the &lt;a href="http://www.wz-newsline.de/sro.php?redid=334646"&gt;Westdeutsche Zeitung &lt;/a&gt;(a local paper), though the article misquoted me (I do not and never did think that American papers were more pro-McCain than German papers; rather, McCain got more coverage in American papers than in their German counterparts.)  To say the least, German media kept a close eye on the election, reporting on the debates, "Joe the Plumber" hitting the campaign trail, etc.  German friends would ask me about the election, what were my thoughts, if I thought Obama had a good chance of winning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Election Day finally rolled around (and the weekend before it could not have gone any slower).  I &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SRRfQllXnvI/AAAAAAAAAGo/qYepGvOmshc/s1600-h/DSC00343.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SRRfQllXnvI/AAAAAAAAAGo/qYepGvOmshc/s200/DSC00343.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265938602874347250" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;baked "Obama cookies" from scratch, from the cookies themselves to the frosting.  Granted, my first batch was rock hard and I threw them out and made a second batch (shown here), but I was definitely excited about them.  A friend from my program last year, Rob, who lives in Pforzheim came up just for the election because he wanted to watch it with some fellow Americans.  We went to a small party at this guy Frankie's apartment, whom I had met through the Democrats Abroad.  The group there was pretty diverse considering the electorate at home: a Jew, a black man, two white Catholic guys, a Filipino Catholic, a German who had lived in D.C. for awhile, and me.  On top of that, we had a three person crew from WDR (West Deutscher Rundfunk, one of Europe's biggest media companies) filming us for a story.  We hadn't felt like going to Cologne for the big party there, but we had a great time anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short since everyone knows what the outcome was, &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SRRlC-vNwRI/AAAAAAAAAGw/rSgk4YjvKPY/s1600-h/IMG_6881.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SRRlC-vNwRI/AAAAAAAAAGw/rSgk4YjvKPY/s200/IMG_6881.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265944966178128146" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;we were celebrating victory at 6 a.m.  Though our party was not big, emotions were running high and our WDR crew definitely woke up a little more at that point.  (They were the only ones showing any signs of getting tired in the early hours of the morning)  Going home on the train was slightly funny because we moved against the flow of traffic and thought it was almost like a walk of shame, except that the walk of shame was a walk of victory.  (Or "wictory" as some Germans might say?)  If you want to see the video that WDR made of us, you can &lt;a href="http://www.einslive.de/medien/html/1live/2008/11/05/hier-und-heute-usa-wahl.xml"&gt;see it here&lt;/a&gt; (it also covers the bigger Dems Abroad party in Cologne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Wednesday, I got calls from some Germans congratulating me on the new president.  Everywhere you went, you could hear Germans talking about Obama and the U.S.  I felt that I could say, "Hey, I'm American!" and be proud of the fact, rather than sort of mumbling it and being embarrassed.  Because of the time difference, the newspapers didn't come out with the story until Thursday, but every single paper had a picture of Obama and/or his family, with headlines like "The dream is finally true" and  "The new hope for America."  It was impossible to doubt: The U.S. did well in the eyes of German media.  We proved that we can change, that we are flexible, that we are a nation of hopes and dreams and the impossible is possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SRRlSZ_RStI/AAAAAAAAAG4/pnYoQKrbi-s/s1600-h/IMG_6899.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SRRlSZ_RStI/AAAAAAAAAG4/pnYoQKrbi-s/s200/IMG_6899.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265945231191263954" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'm sure that people living in the U.S. have seen articles about the world rejoicing, but I can say that it is really true and not exaggerated.  We just turned a page of history and I, along with the Germans I know, are looking forward to the future.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/7096535756819726074/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=7096535756819726074&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7096535756819726074'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7096535756819726074'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2008/11/2008-election-from-germany.html' title='The 2008 Election - From Germany'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SRRlkgpCsFI/AAAAAAAAAHA/cOFlF38T8YA/s72-c/IMG_6884.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-2748510022395162294</id><published>2008-09-05T15:38:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2008-09-05T16:09:32.051+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Another Tale of German Bureaucracy</title><content type='html'>It's been a rather long time since I updated my blog.  The reason why I decided to finally write something again?  Because I'm sitting at home in Düsseldorf, barred from working due to the fact that I have no Arbeitserlaubnis (work permit). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you heard me talking before I left Germany in July to go to the States, I had planned on applying for everything at the consulate in New York.  Well, I tried and the consulate told me I should just do it when I got here to Germany.  I'm guessing that they didn't want to try processing the paperwork because they said they had to send it to Germany anyway, or someone really just didn't feel like doing their job.  (Eh, it happens.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After coming back here, I didn't have enough time to collect the extra paperwork required to apply here in Germany before I left for Salzburg for a short weekend trip with Christian.  (Yes, the hills were alive with the Sound of Music, and yes, I made him go on a Sound of Music tour with me.)  We came back to Düsseldorf for a day before jetting off again to Berlin for a few days since Alex and Elise were in town.  When I finally got back to Düsseldorf, I had all the necessary paperwork from my (hopefully) future employers and was able to apply last Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now comes the wait.  I went to the Ausländerbehörde (Aliens Department?  That sounds too science fiction-y...let's say Foreigners Office) and handed in my stuff there.  In the meantime, I received a "Fiktionsbescheinigung," which I don't have an English equivalent of, except for "fictional certificate."  Obviously, this sounds like a joke, something that should only exist in my imagination, but it is pretty much a temporary residence permit for 3 months since the day I applied for residence and work permits, not since the day I entered Germany.  (So I bought myself, literally, an extra two weeks time for 20€.)  The man in the Ausländerbehörde said that the Arbeitsamt (Labor Office) could take anywhere between a few days and 10 weeks to approve my work permit, but until then, I'm not allowed to work.  Fantastic.  A few days versus oh, 70 days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I'm not allowed to work, this has been my daily routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-wake up at 9 a.m. since I would have to wake up at 9 for work.&lt;br /&gt;-turn on the computer at around 9:20 and read the news for two hours or more from various sources, like the NY Times, LA Times, Washington Post, NPR, BBC, Der Spiegel, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine.  I tend to start stressing about world events at this point.&lt;br /&gt;-once done with the news, I switch to &lt;a href="www.thedailyshow.com"&gt;TheDailyShow.com&lt;/a&gt; and watch the previous night's episode of the Daily Show in order to relieve some of the stress.&lt;br /&gt;-after the Daily Show, I watch the previous night's episode of the Colbert Report.&lt;br /&gt;-at this time, usually around 1 p.m., I finally get hungry.  I scrounge around the kitchen for anything to eat because I'm a bit lazy and don't want to go out while it's raining to the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;-the afternoon is spent either playing Guitar Hero, reading a book, or brushing up on my Cantonese.  "Brushing up on my Cantonese" means me trying to use a book my mom gave me to learn to read (the characters are kind of small) and/or watching a Chinese soap opera called The Drive of Life.&lt;br /&gt;-the afternoon at some point will also consist of me coming back online to talk to all the people at home just arriving at work.  This pretty much ends up occupying the rest of my time before I get bored and go back to any of the three activities listed above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that's pretty much my daily routine until Christian gets back, when we'll cook dinner and then sit around watching trashy German television.  (Admittedly, it's pretty funny.)  The evening usually goes by pretty quickly because I'm actually talking to someone rather than just IMing with them.  I might read some more, do some more Cantonese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people say that I should enjoy the time while I wait for my work permit to get approved, but at the same time, I feel absolutely helpless.  Of course, the situation is out of my hands and if the Arbeitsamt feels like rejecting my application, then I need to find a plan B pronto.  Additionally, because I'm sitting around reading the news all day, I tend to get stressed out about the upcoming election, which, like the work permit, is also out of my hands.  It doesn't help that I get infuriated by both sides when I read articles, op-eds, comments under the articles or on YouTube that are misinformed about either side, skew the facts, sexist, racist, etc. etc.  It makes me just want to scream, "Can't we just focus on the policies here?  Who cares if Barack Obama is black?!  Who cares if Sarah Palin is a woman?!  Get the facts right and move on!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don't like being political in my blog, but I guess since I have time, I will devote some of it to writing about that the next time...but for now, I'm just hoping that I get a work permit soon.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/2748510022395162294/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=2748510022395162294&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2748510022395162294'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/2748510022395162294'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2008/09/another-tale-of-german-bureaucracy.html' title='Another Tale of German Bureaucracy'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-6019846103822544997</id><published>2008-06-26T13:46:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2008-06-26T14:40:52.719+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Wir sind im Finale!</title><content type='html'>Unless you live under a rock or in the United States, you would know that the European Cup (for this little sport called soccer) is happening at the moment.  It's probably the biggest sporting event here in Europe after the World Cup and similar to two years ago, there are flags of every country hanging from windows and flying from cars.  Interestingly enough, I think Germans are showing their national pride more than they did two years ago, even though the European Cup is taking place in Austria and Switzerland.  It's probably a result of two years ago that they actually showed pride and now feel like it's OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night Germany played against Turkey and it was &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;intense&lt;/span&gt;.  In order to understand why, it's important to know that the Turkish population in Germany is extraordinarily high.  When I lived in Berlin, my neighborhood Kreuzberg was pretty much a Little Istanbul.  Interestingly enough, Turkish families can live in Germany for generations but never get German citizenship.  To make a comparison, Germany playing Turkey would be similar to the United States playing Mexico in a sport that everyone cared about (I don't mean soccer, I just mean it generally).  Even then, I don't think the comparison even comes close to what the game meant.  I will definitely admit that I probably don't comprehend what exactly it meant because of the deeper political and cultural issues that exist between Germans and the Turkish population, even if I have spent 2 years living in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turkey scored the first goal of the night, but not too soon afterward, Germany brought the score to a tie.  During the second half of the game (around the 59th minute, I think), the TV feed suddenly went dead for a good six or seven minutes.  Everyone was shouting, complaining, and wondering why the feed wasn't working.  (Apparently a transponder or something was struck by lightning)  Luckily, the Swiss television station kicked in and their feed was shown instead.  Two more goals were scored by each team and it looked like the game would go into overtime, but then Phillip Lahm from the German team made an incredible shot in the 89th minute for a German win.  It was really amazing and considering that the Turks have made some seriously awesome comebacks during the Euro Cup, I was a little nervous that they would score, but there wasn't enough time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching the game with Greg, Megan, and Megan's roommate, we went over to Zülpicher Platz because we knew that everybody would be out on the street partying.  It was total chaos, everyone cheering, cars honking, people dancing in the street and waving flags around.  My three companions left because they needed to go home, but I found Johannes and Matthias from work and continued partying with them instead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Germany is in the final on Sunday against either Russia or Spain, depending on who wins the game tonight.  It'll be extremely exciting because Germany is in the final and if they played like how they did against Portugal, I think they have a good chance of winning.  If they play like they did last night against Turkey (even though they won), I'm not sure if they would have a good chance at all.  My dad arrives in Germany on Sunday and I'm going to bring him somewhere to watch the game.  It's called culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the time being, I can't upload any photos...but I will once I transfer them to my computer.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/6019846103822544997/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=6019846103822544997&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/6019846103822544997'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/6019846103822544997'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2008/06/wir-sind-im-finale.html' title='Wir sind im Finale!'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-9202566020480011545</id><published>2008-05-22T16:09:00.002+02:00</published><updated>2008-05-22T16:13:17.649+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Indiana Jones &amp; The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</title><content type='html'>First off, I promise I am not giving ANYTHING away.  I am discussing no plot points whatsoever...so it's ok if you read on.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night, I saw Indy 4 and it actually wasn't that bad.  If you think about the other movies and how absurd they are (I mean, c'mon, the Ark killing everyone?  The dude taking the heart out of the other guy?  The Holy Grail?), it's not that bad.  Sure, you think, "Wait, wtf?" but then you realize, at least it sort of has to do with archaeology and it's better than &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Temple of Doom&lt;/span&gt;.  Shia LaBeouf is not nearly as annoying as Shorty, though he does have some points where you just want to slap him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are definitely way more kitschier moments than in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Last Crusade&lt;/span&gt;, but the absurd is pretty comparable to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Raiders&lt;/span&gt;.  Some of the jokes were necessary in some way because Harrison Ford is (much) older.  The special effects could've used some work, but I don't think they were going for reality...I think they sort of wanted to keep with the cheesiness of the original movies and how the effects weren't 100% convincing.  The "phobia scene" was pretty good, though.  I definitely thought, "Ew, gross" like in the other movies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I think the audience that I saw it with was not as into it as my family and I are.  They definitely missed a ton of jokes and references to old movies.  They also 100% missed the homage to Star Wars when Harrison Ford says, "I've got a bad feeling about this!"  I laughed a lot at that, but no one else seemed to.  Silly Germans.  It could be due to the fact that perhaps they hadn't seen the movies in English and thus missed a ton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would say that I was entertained and got my 5€ worth.  I hope that a fifth movie will not be made because honestly, an Indiana Jones movie is not an Indiana Jones movie without Harrison Ford.  He can't possibly make a fifth movie and being relegated to the role of sidekick next to Shia LaBeouf would just be an outrage.  This movie doesn't let down like the last three Star Wars that came out and definitely does not suck as much as Jurassic Park 3 did. Though one thing definitely did suck:  The Communists are not nearly as bad ass as the Nazis.  It doesn't ring..."Communists...""Reds..." blah blah.  Nope.  It's always going to be "Nazis...I hate these guys!"  As much as I love Germans, they're very good at being bad...at least in Indiana Jones movies.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/9202566020480011545/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=9202566020480011545&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/9202566020480011545'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/9202566020480011545'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2008/05/indiana-jones-kingdom-of-crystal-skull.html' title='Indiana Jones &amp; The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-3930674247914677717</id><published>2008-05-18T18:59:00.003+02:00</published><updated>2008-05-18T19:17:44.220+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Forever and a Day</title><content type='html'>I do realize that it's been forever since I last wrote an entry, but after entering the 9-5 world of having a job, life abroad tends to be a little less exciting.  Working at Clipfish has been a lot of fun and I've been learning about internet media.  I've decided that it's not exactly where I want to go in life...I'll leave that to other people.  My coworkers are all very friendly and we can all have a good laugh together, but because I generally tend to avoid Köln (aka my apartment) on the weekend, I don't go out with the other interns nearly as much as I would like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I have spent pretty much every weekend in Düsseldorf with Christian and his friends.  David (friend and fellow participant in my program) moved to Düsseldorf in March or so, so I see him on the weekend occasionally as well.  The weather last week was amazing: sunny, warm (70 degrees Fahrenheit, 22 degrees Celsius) and summery.  The sun goes down now quite late at around 9-9:30.  Last Friday was Christian's birthday and we spent 8 hours outside with his friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other developments that have happened since my last entry is that I'm officially moving to Germany after my program is done.  I managed to secure another internship in Düsseldorf at a small editing house called &lt;a href="http://www.pirates-www.de/flash_content/pirates.html"&gt;Pirates n Paradise&lt;/a&gt;.  They edit commericals for TV for products like Schwarzkopf, Chio Chips, Cab Beer (actually any kind of beer that is with the Krombacher group), etc.  There might be a job at the end of the internship which would be pretty sweet, but I'm not banking on it.  I'm just sort of using it as a way to get a visa in order to stay and keep searching for a job I want.  I have decided, however, that after this internship, I can't do any more, otherwise, I will be stuck doing internships for the rest of my life.  I need money!  The good thing about them being in Düsseldorf is that it means I can move in with Christian.  I'm definitely looking forward to that instead of having to take the regional train every weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've also finally started up my website/guide to living abroad in Germany.  If you want to check it out, you can see it &lt;a href="http://www.livebreatheabroad.com/germany/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I had written way more articles for it, but unfortunately, my computer broke last week.  I'm not sure what's wrong with it except that the screen won't come on and it doesn't work when I hook it up to an external monitor.  Bleh.  I wrote a few articles and saved them on there but didn't post them, so they'll have to wait.  Feedback would be greatly appreciated...just remember that it's very barebones and I still need to add links and photos.  I think I'll probably get a lot of work done on it when I'm at home for a month before I come back here.  I'm currently using Christian's laptop since he just bought a new desktop.  It isn't worth it really to pay to get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, not much else has been happening.  I already have tickets to go see Indiana Jones 4 on Wednesday evening, so for all you guys in the U.S. : HA!  I get to see it before you.  (And of course in English)  Hopefully it'll be good.  Saturday I'm leaving for Berlin because we have our closing seminar and I'll be there for a week.  Then 4 weeks left working at Clipfish, Ba comes to visit at the end of June, two weeks in July free (one of those weeks will be spent in Berlin with Ba), and then I'm back in the States.

Christmas was fun because Tracie came to visit and we celebrated with Christian and his family.  We mainly kept busy doing tourist stuff, drinking Glühwein, and visiting Christmas markets.  It was a good Christmas.  Then I spent another New Year's in Berlin with Christian and friends Timm and Patricia, which of course, was a blast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In January, I was in Dresden for a week for my program's mid-year seminar.  There were 24 other people there and it was really great seeing some familiar faces again.  Dresden is a beautiful city and we were also in Leipzig for a day, where I would've liked to spend more time, but that will be for the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2387/2192703388_4fea57dbc6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 230px; height: 173px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2387/2192703388_4fea57dbc6_b.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks after I was in Dresden, I went with David and Paige&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2095/2223021676_2ba496aed5_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 255px; height: 192px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2095/2223021676_2ba496aed5_o.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (two friends not in Köln, but they were for the language course phase) to Valmeinier, France, to go snowboarding for a week.  It was my first time outside of Germany since arriving in August, and it made for a very relaxing, fun trip.  We had some really good powder because one day it snowed a bit and the visibility was really poor.  However, the next day, one mountain was fantastic with really wide, long runs.  I also finally realized riding a board the right size for me is a lot less strenuous (I mean, this is a huge "duh," I know, but I like my board at home) and therefore, I will have to get a new board for next year.  For the week, I think I spent less than 650€, all expenses included, even the fondue (the best fondue I've had in my life) and raclette that we had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, fast forward to now.  Last week, the final phase of our internship started.  I had to start work on Monday, even though it was Rosenmontag, the biggest day for Karneval.  If you don't know why this is significant, let's just put it this way: Köln is &lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; city to celebrate Karneval (Mardi Gras over a few days) and when I told people I had to work Rosenmontag, they all asked, "Spinnst du??"  (Are you crazy??)  For a better description of Karneval, read my &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2006/03/karneval-prague.html"&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt; from two years ago in Düsseldorf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company I work for is &lt;a href="http://www.clipfish.de/"&gt;Clipfish&lt;/a&gt;, a German competitor of YouTube and subsidiary of RTL, the biggest TV, radio, and production company in Europe.  Unfortunately, you can't access the website if you're living in the U.S., so you can't see the stuff that I deal with.  The reason for it is that there is a "Sexy Videos" category that would be considered pornographic at home and I guess it's easier to just block the entire site, rather than having to make sure everyone consents to the content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/R683KsOfdBI/AAAAAAAAADw/UUdWHENJUd4/s1600-h/Picture+1.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 241px; height: 166px;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/R683KsOfdBI/AAAAAAAAADw/UUdWHENJUd4/s320/Picture+1.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165407954427409426" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This actually brings me to an interesting point about my internship.  One task I have to do is read through complaints, whether they have to do with copyrighted material, videos that might be considered "too brutal," videos that are "damaging" to your person, videos that are considered "immoral" or "pornographic" by some users, etc.  I have to sit and watch the videos that people complained about, deciding whether or not they should be taken down or not.  The pornography complaints are interesting because of the fact that most of the "Sexy Videos" offend my American sensibilities and I would just automatically write them off as pornographic in the U.S.  However, because I am in Germany, I usually ask the other intern if they're a little more extreme and always attach "Sorry to ask you again, but as an American, this is porn, but what do you think?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you know me personally, you know that the main topic of my senior thesis was comparing pornography law between (the former) West Germany and the U.S. during the Sexual Revolution.  You would think that this would help me with my job sifting through the videos.  Yes, it does, but putting pornography law into practice on the&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/R683esOfdCI/AAAAAAAAAD4/Uq16kCCF8hM/s1600-h/Picture+2.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 255px; height: 173px;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/R683esOfdCI/AAAAAAAAAD4/Uq16kCCF8hM/s200/Picture+2.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165408298024793122" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; internet is much different than with film and printed material today.  Additionally, the fact that I grew up in a society where pornography is easy to spot makes it difficult to say if something here is or isn't (basically, boobs are a good indication and anything below the belt is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;definitely&lt;/span&gt; porn) .  For example, German pornography law states that if a sexual organ is portrayed in a way that emphasizes intercourse (whether it is actual sex or masturbation), then it is pornographic.  However, the important thing to know is that you can see a vagina or a penis on television if it's in a documentary, even if it is a documentary on sex drive, masturbation, or having kids.  For me, the area that gets really gray is when there are videos that have a girl stripping down naked and shows her crotch, but it's not a close up or anything.  As I already said, that's definitely porn in the U.S., but here, it's pretty difficult to say yes or no, and that's when I ask the other intern.  (The picture I posted is a screenshot of the "Sexy Videos" page I made for those of you who can't access Clipfish from the U.S.  It'll give you a vague idea of what I am talking about and it's probably NSFW if you click on it to make it bigger.  I made sure to make it small enough if you're reading this page that you don't get in trouble.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a completely different note, I had an interesting experience on Friday when the building had to be evacuated.  The reason?  "Bombenentschärfung," or in English, a bomb needed to be defused.  Have no fear, it wasn't a terrorist looking to blow up RTL's offices.  Instead, construction workers nearby found a bomb from World War II not too far away from the offices that had never exploded during the war and therefore, needed it to be defused because it could theoretically still explode even though it's more than 60 years old.  I thought it was a completely crazy idea, but apparently this happens now and then throughout Germany and for Germans, it's nothing new.  In fact, it was just a pain in the ass, a disturbance to the normal work day.  We had to stand outside the building for about 2 hours (the other interns and I sat around talking and played word games) and then were allowed back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, an interesting first week...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/1459423522912475666/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=1459423522912475666&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1459423522912475666'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/1459423522912475666'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2008/02/german-porn-law-in-practice-bombs.html' title='German Porn Law in Practice &amp; Bombs'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2387/2192703388_4fea57dbc6_t.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-6513456413835293540</id><published>2007-11-29T01:27:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2007-11-29T02:08:27.996+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Concerts to the Max</title><content type='html'>This past week has been rather ridiculous with shows.  In the past 8 days, I have to been four different concerts:  Die Ärzte, The Donnas, Die Fantastischen Vier, and The Hives.   Two weeks ago I was also at the Kaiser Chiefs, but I won't really go into that because I was by myself and didn't take any pictures. To say the least, they were all very different.  So just a quick review and some photos (but you can see all of them on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; page) from this week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2215/2055426329_449740f0d5.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 276px; height: 216px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2215/2055426329_449740f0d5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Die Ärzte (The Doctors) are a German punk band from Berlin.  They rock.  The show was in the ginormous Kölnarena, which holds about 40,000 people, I think.  Despite the monstrous venue, it was still a fantastic show.  They played a mix of their old and new songs for three full hours and no opening band.  Granted that I do not know a lot of their music, I had a good time with Kari and her boyfriend who came down for the show.  Unfortunately, our seats were way up high and pretty far back, but even so, awesome time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Saturday, I went to go see The Donnas with Christian at a small club called Underground, which has a capacity of 350 people.&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2121/2061842953_09f9f1bac7.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 287px; height: 216px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2121/2061842953_09f9f1bac7.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Quite the opposite of Kölnarena!  I'd like to point out the fact that this show was my 50th concert ever (I think).  If it wasn't my 50th, one of the 4 this week definitely was.  The Donnas were amazing and the new songs are killer.  Of course, I was the most psyched to hear "Take It Off" since Stiny and I named our radio show after it.  It was weird because the Donnas would say they were playing something "old school," which meant it was from the album &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Spend the Night&lt;/span&gt; (which came out in 2002).  They played nothing off any earlier albums and only "Fall Behind Me" off of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Gold Medal&lt;/span&gt;.  I was a bit surprised to realize that I am an "old school fan," but proud of it.  Oddly enough, the majority of the people there knew only new stuff off &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Bitchin'&lt;/span&gt;.  Slightly sad that they only played for about an hour and a half, but nonetheless, that hour and a half was fun.  Definitely better than when I saw them perform with Jet on Halloween a few years ago, except for the fact that they played no super old school songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2245/2065798542_d6a7502559.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 234px; height: 313px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2245/2065798542_d6a7502559.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The following day, Sunday, was back in the Kölnarena to see the German hip-hop group Die Fantastischen Vier (The Fantastic Four) with David and Zach.  They're pretty much the Beastie Boys of Germany.  Anyhow, the show was definitely really well thought out with lights and background and well, just plain frickin &lt;span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"&gt;cool&lt;/span&gt;.  I knew way more songs from Die Fanta Vier than from Die Ärzte, so I think I enjoyed myself a lot more.  Not to mention our seats were much farther down. Die Fanta Vier also played for a long time (about 2.5 hours) and played a lot of old songs, like "Geboren," "Der Picknicker," and "Hausmeister Thomas D."  Favorite songs of the night had to be "Take It Back" and "Was Geht."  All in all, I have to say that the show was so good, in fact, that I think Die Fanta Vier are definitely in my top 5 arena shows, definitely over Madonna.  One encore they did had a stage come down from the ceiling and then three of the four came out and rapped on it.  Pretty sweet, if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, to top it all off, I saw The Hives tonight.  Now, I've seen The Hives before, and they rocked then, and they still do.  I managed to squeeze&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2165/2072660138_d86b89c26f.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2165/2072660138_d86b89c26f.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; my way to the front against the barrier, which was really fun, but at the same time, not super fantastic because I got super squashed.  It is interesting, though, that I felt really old in comparison to everyone else there.  All of the girls were really flat and not curvy at all, and a high school student hit on me (sort of).  The other thing is that I wasn't in the middle of the action like I was 3 years ago.  That's when you know I'm getting old(er), when I think to myself, "I'm getting too old for this shit to jump around with teenagers."  The show, of course, was indescribably amazing.  Pelle really knows how to work the crowd into a frenzy (literally), his brother Nicholas Arson has the craziest expressions (and yet somehow they are kind of sexy), drummer Chris Dangerous is way hotter than I remember him being, and Dr. Matt Destruction and Vigilante Carlstroem rock really hard.  The first three definitely have the hot rocker thing about them.  (The other two are just not my type)  Unfortunately, I had to go to this show alone because nobody wanted or was able to come.  (Hence the high schooler hitting on me...sort of.)  Despite this fact, I rocked my ass off and must say, The Hives win for best show of the weekend/month/year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a completely different note, I don't have to worry about finding an internship anymore because I found one, woo!  It's with a German company called Clipfish.de, which is a subsidiary of RTL, the biggest entertainment channel in the country.  The website is unfortunately inaccessible within the U.S. because it's blocked, but to put it simply, it's YouTube for Germans, with music videos from Sony BMG (they have a contract), some stuff that Americans would consider soft-core porn, etc.  I'm really excited about it because it'll be a great opportunity to learn about new media, woo.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/6513456413835293540/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=6513456413835293540&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/6513456413835293540'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/6513456413835293540'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2007/11/concerts-to-max.html' title='Concerts to the Max'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2215/2055426329_449740f0d5_t.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-352656533197428069</id><published>2007-11-15T21:28:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2007-11-15T21:53:41.423+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Christmas in Köln Kommt (You like that alliteration?)</title><content type='html'>Christmas in Köln (and the rest of the world) is fast approaching.  One difference, however, is that Christmas goods have been available here to buy since about mid-October.  At home, we have Halloween and Thanksgiving to keep the Christmas stuff off shelves a little longer, though not by much.  The one thing, however, that makes Christmas here way better is the traditional Weihnachtsmärkte (Christmas markets), which are getting built up in almost every free space around the city.  I've already been snacking on Spekulatius (ginger bread cookies), but soon I'll be able to enjoy Glühwein, the smell of baked goods, and Christmas lights everywhere in the markets.  Here are some pictures of the Christmas markets being built around the city:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2223/2034849417_79faf004e7.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 268px; height: 201px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2223/2034849417_79faf004e7.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This will be the Christmas market in Heumarkt.  Only on Sunday was it full of people celebrating the beginning of Karneval season (which I didn't go to because of the pouring rain), and soon it will be full of people looking for Christmas gifts, drinking Glühwein, and snacking on warm baked goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2260/2034847151_686f785e71.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 182px; height: 244px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2260/2034847151_686f785e71.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the Kölner Dom (Cathedral) with the Christmas market being built up.  I wonder if it will beat the Berliner Christmas market around the Kaiser Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche for being pretty.  The markets open up in about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a different note, the locomotive drivers (uh, conductors?  Lokführer in German) have been striking on and off here since we've gotten here.  The reason is that they want to get paid more, which I don't blame them before.  Without going through a long explanation, it's been a little inconvenient for people who take trains everywhere, especially if they are living in the eastern part of the country.  Today I went to the main train station here in Köln and it was a lot emptier than normal.  For one, the platforms were almost completely empty, even though about 70% of the trains were running here in Nordrhein-Westphalia.  For another, I only saw one train on the tracks.  And lastly, the Service Point's line was a little longer than usual.  I can only imagine what it's like in the east.  And some pictures from the train station today:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2394/2035643204_24deabfaf0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 290px; height: 218px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2394/2035643204_24deabfaf0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the train station from the outside.  Usually people are rushing in and out and the plaza in front of it is full of people.  I went at around 2 pm, which is obviously not rush hour, but at the same time, is a pretty busy hour for the train station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2313/2034842969_f63348e6cd.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 261px; height: 196px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2313/2034842969_f63348e6cd.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All of the trains that say "Zug fällt aus" means it was canceled.  Luckily a lot of the trains in Nordrhein-Westphalia were still running.  In the east, it's probably just lines of "Zug fällt aus."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2411/2034843499_fa47a4a32d.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 274px; height: 206px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2411/2034843499_fa47a4a32d.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here you can see how empty the train station is.  The platforms are usually full with people waiting and the tracks usually have a train approaching, leaving, or standing.  It's almost like &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;28 Days Later&lt;/span&gt;, but just not so extreme.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/352656533197428069/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=352656533197428069&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/352656533197428069'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/352656533197428069'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2007/11/christmas-in-kln-kommt-you-like-that.html' title='Christmas in Köln Kommt (You like that alliteration?)'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2223/2034849417_79faf004e7_t.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-7397885995301866176</id><published>2007-11-06T00:35:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2007-11-06T01:28:46.112+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Germans Are (Generally) Really Tall</title><content type='html'>Ok, so the title for this post might be a wee bit obvious.  However, it pertains to the fact that I hate it when there are a bunch of really tall guys (and girls!) standing in front of me at a concert.  I went to see the Kaiser Chiefs by myself and somehow, I wound up behind at least 10 people that were all 5 feet 10 inches or taller.  I thought perhaps that my observation two years ago at the Franz Ferdinand show was just nonsense because we got to the show late.  I thought, hmm, maybe all the tall guys are standing in the back because they're being courteous.  No, that isn't the case.  Germans are generally really tall, so it seems, or at least, the ones who always go to the shows that I go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To comment on the Kaiser Chiefs' performance, I must say, I was a bit disappointed in comparison to the &lt;a href="http://boondoxgarage.blogspot.com/2005_05_01_archive.html"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; I saw them.  However, this probably has to do with the fact that I saw them my first time at the Stone Pony and that has a capacity of 775 people.  The venue I saw them this time, E-Werk, has a capacity of 2,000 and I think the effect is that the lead singer did not have as much energy as in the smaller place.  Not to mention, I went to the show by myself, so that always has an effect on how I enjoy it.  Anyway, all that said and done, it was a very fun show from the aspect of the band and music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, there were some really annoying people in my area.  If I were to make the rules for going to concerts, this is what they would be.  Call me mean, but damn, I'm coming up to my 50th concert, so I have some sort of backing to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concert-going Rules According to Me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Hey, tall people.  It'd be nice if you stood all together and let the shorter people in front of you.  I'm not necessarily saying that they should all stand in the back, but tall people should group together and fight it out which tall guy (or girl) gets to be in front of all of them.  Then all the people under 5' 10" can stand in front of the taller people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Concerts are &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; a place to make out with your significant other.  I don't care if your special song is being played live.  It would be much appreciated if you did not make out and block my view or someone else's view.  Also, stop grabbing your significant other's butt/boob/hip/etc.  Think of it this way: It makes it that much easier for someone else to cop a feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  If you have long hair and put it in a ponytail, be aware of what you do with it.  Even if it's not in a ponytail, be aware of what your long hair is doing.  I hate being at a show with a girl in front of me with long hair jumping around.  I do not like having your hair in my face.  How do I know you don't have lice or something crawling on your head?  Also, a mouthful of someone else's hair is just nasty in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  If you can't jump or clap to the beat of the song, please stop jumping or clapping.  You're just going to screw up everyone else.  Plus, you're just going to look silly jumping/clapping on the 1 and 3 instead of the 2 and 4.  (If you know what I'm talking about, awesome.  If not, hopefully you just do it because jumping/clapping on the 1 and 3 is just unnatural.)  If the song is not in 4/4 time or you don't know what I'm talking about, just jump/clap to the downbeats and make it easy on yourself.  Yeah, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  If you push/kick/shove/punch me, you are fair game to be pushed/kicked/shoved/punched back.  Simple as that.  Just because I am smaller does not necessarily mean I can't push/kick/shove/punch back.  Oh, and that goes for being a girl, as well.  Everyone is fair game in the mosh pit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Stop staring at me because I am the only Asian (or oftentimes just plain non-Caucasian) there.  What's the big frickin' deal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yes, for now, I think this is a good list of concert-going rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I'd like to comment on the fact that Germans &lt;span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"&gt;love&lt;/span&gt; clapping.  I've noticed that quite often at concerts or on television.  Germans love clapping to the rhythm of the song, although tonight, there were a lot of people who didn't know how to keep a steady beat.  Christian and his sister commented on this, too, but honestly, Germans will clap to anything, whether it's a slow ballad, an upbeat dance theme, a loud rock song, or Volksmusik.  They will clap their hands off to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g&lt;/span&gt;.  In the U.S., I feel like not so many people clap willingly.  I know I definitely went through a phase in life where I thought, "Wow, clapping to this song is an old people thing to do."  Maybe that's just me.  But seriously.  Germans.  Clap.  To.  Everything.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/7397885995301866176/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=7397885995301866176&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7397885995301866176'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7397885995301866176'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2007/11/germans-are-generally-really-tall.html' title='Germans Are (Generally) Really Tall'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-8091682319957815924</id><published>2007-10-17T11:03:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2007-10-17T12:11:32.199+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Ich bin ein Sonntagskind (but I was born on a Tuesday)</title><content type='html'>There's a saying in German that someone is a "Sonntagskind" (literally a Sunday child, or a child born on Sunday) because children born on Sunday supposedly have luck.  I was born on a Tuesday, but I am definitely pretty lucky.  Classes at the university started on Monday and to be honest, the fact that I am done with my bachelor's has made me care even less about picking courses.  I am less motivated than when I was in Berlin and my motivation level here is incomparable to that which I had in Middlebury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for my Sonntagskind title is simple: I showed up to a class today where I could learn some practical, hands-on stuff for film.  However, about 80 or so other people also decided to show up and it turned out that the class had only 15 slots.  The professor handed out slips of paper where we wrote our names and put them in a bucket, then picked out the 15 people who would be able to take the class.  At this point, I thought about leaving because my chances were slim and I thought it was a terrible system, but at the same time, forced myself to stay since I was already there.  To my great surprise, my name was picked out.  It almost felt like a Golden Ticket type situation like in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Charlie &amp;amp; The Chocolate Factory&lt;/span&gt; and many people went home disappointed.  One girl showed up late and hadn't even put her name into the drawing.  She begged and begged to be let in, but the professor had to say no because if he made an exception for her, all the other people would also want the opportunity.  This isn't the only time that I've had my name picked for something so coveted, either, and that's why Christian said that I'm a Sonntagskind.  (Another saying that he taught me about being lucky: "Die Sonne scheint aus deinem Arsch."  Literally, the sun shines out of your ass.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another sort-of-lucky, but also educated-guess thing yesterday happened in this course, The Differences Between British and American English, which is taught in English.  We were allowed to ask our professor questions and someone asked her where she was from.  She had us guess and the first guess was "Arkansas?."  That was wrong and the second guess was "New Orleans?," which was also wrong.  Now, I have a good feeling that the German students made these guesses because the professor is black.  So I finally just blurted out, "Washington D.C., but you've spent some time in England."  I had to explain why I thought that, so with all 200 pairs of eyes on me (and I turned bright red), I said, "Well, you say certain things like a Southerner, others like a Northerner, but you definitely have a British accent thrown in somewhere there."  It turns out I was right: The professor is from New York, but her mother is from Maryland and her father is British English, but she went to University of Maryland.  Admittedly, I felt pretty good about myself that I had (educated-ly) guessed correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a completely different note, I am finally posting pictures of my apartment because I finally took them and uploaded them.  So here they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2211/1596951847_7c777af1c5.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2211/1596951847_7c777af1c5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my room with the sun shining in.  Christian's mom got me the bed and mattress from friends, Christian's old roommate gave me the TV, and Christian gave me the lamps, speakers on the floor, and the TV stand.  I bought the rugs and the chair from Ikea, all for less than 50€.  I also got a wardrobe (a "Schrank") for 30€ but that's not visible in this picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2296/1596953311_ccc7b33320.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 297px; height: 223px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2296/1596953311_ccc7b33320.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is the kitchen.  It's bigger than my kitchen in Berlin, but we don't have a massive cabinet here.  However, it &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;is &lt;/span&gt;nice to be able to sit in the kitchen and eat at the table.  We had a table in Berlin, but our bread box, toaster, and water cooker thingie took up a lot of space.  I wouldn't say that this kitchen is conducive to having Christmas or Thanksgiving here, but it's cozy enough for get togethers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2150/1596954225_ffbfb7c060.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2150/1596954225_ffbfb7c060.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bathroom is set up in an interesting way.  The toilet and the sink are in one room together and then the bathtub/shower is in another room.  It's pretty handy in the morning when one of my roommates wants to shower and I need to use the toilet or sink.  It makes sense.  Sort of like the bathrooms in the LaForce suites back in Middlebury, and unlike the bathrooms in the Atwater suites.  Intelligent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last picture I am going to post is of the smalled Ikea that I have ever seen or been to.  Christian and I went to pick my chair and larger rug up there because it was near his house and they had my chair in stock.  It took us 20 minutes to find the chair walking through the entire store, pay for it, and get a little bit of food.  I couldn't believe how small this Ikea was and that's why I had to take a picture of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2015/1597827318_22e4d6f00b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 292px; height: 219px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2015/1597827318_22e4d6f00b.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, if you are reading this on Facebook, the spacing and everything is probably all messed up.

However, I moved out of my host mom's place and moved into a shared apartment (WG) where I have two 28-year-old German roommates, Volker and Stefanie.  Both seem to be really friendly and do their own things (I hardly see Volker), so I've been cooking for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I've moved into a WG, it's a bit sad because it marked almost everyone else's move from Köln to their permanent placements.  The only people left here in Köln are Daniel, Greg, Jason, Aldous, and me, which I think actually makes up a really good group.  However, there are other people who are not too far away, like those also in Nordrhein-Westfalen, Mainz, Wiesbaden, and Frankfurt.  Hopefully I will be able to see those people once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The past two months flew by and a lot happened.  In order to condense everything so you can read it if you want to or skip over it, I'm writing a commentated list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;1.  People had birthdays and a few of us discovered a jazz club. &lt;/span&gt; I don't have any pictures from Lara's birthday because Daniel, Kari, and I had no desire dealing with a large group and bounced.  However, I do have photos from Justus and John's join celebration in Flanagan's (this Irish bar that caters to the international student population).  &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1060/1484858177_d6dbee4f15.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 262px; height: 195px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1060/1484858177_d6dbee4f15.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;However, Megan, Daniel, Greg, and I wanted to go to a jazz bar we had seen, so we did and had a really great time. The mood was perfect, the music was fun, and the beer pricey but worth it because the money went towards the musicians.  We went another time and saw and old man from our language school who wound up buying us a round of beer and CDs from the performing group.  I had heard from my teacher that the old man smoked cigars, so Greg ran out and got some to smoke with him.  It turned out that the old man had quit smoking cigars two months previously.  My face turned red not from beer but from embarrassment that I had been the one to suggest getting cigars.  (How was I supposed to know?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;2.  Nine of us went to a friendly soccer match, Germany versus Romania. &lt;/span&gt; It was really fun even though we had seats stuck up in the corner and it was pretty much the B-team playing.  We got to hear this cheesy song, "Viva Colonia" multiple times.  This song is for the local Kölner soccer team, 1. FC Köln, but they played it at the national team game anyway.  Who cares?  Besides which, Lukas Podolski used to play for FC Köln.  I managed to guess the outcome of the game correct; Germany won 3 to 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1149/1485671848_ca4984fb6b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1149/1485671848_ca4984fb6b.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;3.  We all finished two months of "intensive" language courses and took tests for them.  &lt;/span&gt;Pat and I had been in Level 8 in August, but passed the test at the end to move up to the next level.  However, the Oberstufe (advanced class) consisted of people in Level 9 and 10, so we just did Level 10 stuff.  In essence, Pat and I skipped a Stufe.  ("Jaaaa!" is what Pat would always say)  Now we can say we're supposedly fluent in German because we passed the Oberstufe exam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;4.  I went to Brühl and Bonn on separate occasions.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1252/1484870335_c86d0b737a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 283px; height: 213px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1252/1484870335_c86d0b737a.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Daniel, this Korean girl from Tajikistan (Tajik?) in our class Lena, and I wanted to go see the Schloss in Brühl, but unfortunately the Deutsche Bank was holding an event there, so we couldn't go.  Then our class went to Bonn on an excursion to the Haus der Geschichte (House of History) and the Beethoven Haus.  It was really interesting and I will have to go back to the Haus der Geschichte.  Daniel and I now have a joke that whenever we're in Bonn (or more like whenever Daniel is in Bonn), we're partying with Beethoven.  (Daniel wants to do orchestral conducting and likes classical music, so it makes sense....Party mit Beethoven!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;5.  I went to Berlin twice to visit Christian and we saw Wir Sind Helden. &lt;/span&gt; While in Berlin, I also saw Andrea once, but managed to miss Devin somehow.  It was surreal being with Andrea in a smoky club in Berlin, but it was definitely fun.  As for seeing Wir Sind Helden,&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1375/1485701856_88ffeea76b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 248px; height: 193px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1375/1485701856_88ffeea76b.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they were really good and I enjoyed them, but I don't think I'd pay to go see them again.  They played a lot of their mellow songs, which are nice to listen to when I'm at home chilling, but when I'm at a concert, I want to dance.  Or jump.  Or mosh.  Ok, admittedly, everyone was jumping in sync when Wir Sind Helden played "Denkmal," but that was strange.  Best songs of the night had to be "Heldenzeit," "Nur Ein Wort," and "Guten Tag."  Well, I suppose "Endlich Ein Grund zur Panik" was good, too...any time the horn players got some good time was pretty much kick ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that pretty much sums up the last two months.  I actually updated &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee"&gt;my Flickr page&lt;/a&gt; as well, so there's a whole bunch of new pictures up if you want to see them.  Hopefully I will be updating this a little more regularly, now that I have regular access to the internet.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/5937271980738286502/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=5937271980738286502&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5937271980738286502'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/5937271980738286502'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2007/10/2-months-in-kln-in-nutshell.html' title='2 Months in Köln in a Nutshell'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1060/1484858177_d6dbee4f15_t.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-144198321714407256</id><published>2007-09-01T18:57:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2007-09-01T19:30:05.172+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Changes in Berlin</title><content type='html'>As I write this entry, I am sitting in Christian's apartment in Berlin.  Last night, we went to a party in *gasp* Zone B from his coworker at the Canadian Embassy.  For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, Berlin is divided into three zones (A, B, C)  for public transportation.  I can't remember who agreed with me, but someone and I said that if you live in Zone B, you live out FAR.  Almost everything is in Zone A; the exceptions are the airports Schönefeld and Tegel.  So we were only one stop further into Zone B, but even so, I still laughed.  After the party, we went to Rosi's (my favorite club on Revaler Straße in Friedrichshain) and met up with Andrea, the German exchange student who was in Middlebury last year.  It was rather surreal seeing her in a club in Berlin because Vermont is just so completely different.  Not to mention she could smoke inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Christian and I walked around the city and went shopping a little bit (but didn't actually buy anything).  I noticed some changes in the city since the last time I was here in March with Alex on spring break. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  There is a new big ass mall being built in Alexanderplatz that is absolutely ugly as hell.  This mall is called "Alexa" and will be opened on September 12, 2007.  Maybe when I'm back here in two weeks for the Wir Sind Helden concert, I'll go take a look.  I mean, that IS the Jersey mallrat in me being curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  There is a new big ass stadium being built across from the East Side Gallery in Friedrichshain.  It's being built mainly as an ice hockey stadium, but I'm sure there will be other uses for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  There is a new (but not big ass) pedestrian bridge being built between the U- and S-bahn stations at Warschauer Straße.  I guess this might make the walk between the two less hell-ish as Ashley always said.  There was a party going on near the construction at 5 in the afternoon under the existing bridge.  So Berlin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  The pedestrian crossing lights (the &lt;a href="http://www.ampelmann.de/"&gt;Ampelmann&lt;/a&gt; lights) are taking over in Kreuzberg and probably the rest of the city, too.  Tourists find this light amusing and it had been used in East Berlin before the Wall came down.  Now they are being placed everywhere in the city and not just the old east because the Ampelmann has sort of become an unofficial mascot of the city.  It looks sort of weird in Kreuzberg, I'm not going to lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  There are babies everywhere and really super pregnant women.  It's like there was a baby explosion and everyone decided to get it on.  It's probably due to the World Cup last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the most important change:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is now graffiti on Cam's apartment's door.  Christian and I were walking along the Simon-Dach-Straße and I saw Cam's apartment door.  It used to be so clean and new and renovated, but because it IS Berlin, it could not escape the graffiti that is everywhere.  Ok, I'm kidding that this is the most important change and I know most of you reading this will probably have no idea what I'm talking about.  But yeah, it just shows you that nothing can escape graffiti here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other change in Berlin is not a physical change on the cityscape.  Instead, it is the way I view it and relate to it.  Because of the fact that I have been living in Köln (Cologne in English, but get used to me saying Köln), Berlin somehow seems a little bit foreign, a little strange.  I've forgotten some of the station names.  The people seem different and I feel like I seem out of place, although that could never be true in Berlin.  The U-bahn trains are louder, the S-bahn is wider, and there are just generally more people (which makes sense since Berlin is bigger than Köln).  I feel like it's easier to be anonymous here and it's easier to get lost.  I don't get nasty and funny looks for speaking English.  I suppose that Köln has made me realize these things about Berlin, and why Berlin is Berlin.  I don't love Berlin more or less.  It's just that I see it differently and it's not the same.  Could you say that this is somewhat like reverse culture shock?  Is that even possible, even though both cities are in Germany?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, I also noticed that there are fewer people in wheelchairs here in Berlin than in Köln or Düsseldorf.  I don't know why that is.  Perhaps it's because Berlin is full of young people popping out babies.  There are fewer babies in Köln, too, so it seems.  Christian and I joked that it was because Köln has all the gay people and older people, so that might be the reason.  Am I becoming un-PC?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/144198321714407256/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=144198321714407256&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/144198321714407256'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/144198321714407256'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2007/09/changes-in-berlin.html' title='Changes in Berlin'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-7152228122210055301</id><published>2007-08-18T19:34:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2007-08-18T20:06:57.941+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>I'm Not Dead Yet...</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/Rsc0SBbeJiI/AAAAAAAAABI/DrGLk26Rf0U/s1600-h/IMG_0408.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 259px; height: 194px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/Rsc0SBbeJiI/AAAAAAAAABI/DrGLk26Rf0U/s320/IMG_0408.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5100102587246323234" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have internet because I'm at Christian's parents' apartment, so I figure I should update my blog.  If you have been to Germany before, you will know what typical German weather is like: cloudy, rainy, unpredictable.  I can't say that it has been any different, although, the weather has been good recently.  Some friends (David, John, Becky, Maggie, Ben) and I went grilling in a park the other day.  Of course, we grilled some wurst, I brought some corn and made pork burgers, and there was Kartoffelsalat (potato salad, very German).  And the key point to grilling wurst in a park in Germany?  Drinking beer with it, obviously.  That's one thing I definitely had missed when I was at home: being able to drink in public, whether in a park or a walking beer.  Then we all somehow became really amused jumping off rocks and taking pictures doing it...ahhh, Köln!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I missed while at home was watching Fußball (uh, soccer).  Today I went with Christian to a bar in Düsseldorf and met his friend Sven there.  Today's Spieltag was pretty sweet: Werder Bremen (my favorite team) vs. FC Bayern München, Schalke vs. Dortmund, Hertha BSC vs. Stuttgart, Wolfsburg vs. Duisburg, and some others.  Man, the Bremen/München game was ridiculous at a 0-4 loss for Bremen.  I still don't like the fact that Miroslav Klose is playing for München now.  He should still be in Bremen...But anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the same note, 8 friends and I will be going to a Germany vs. Romania game in Köln on September 12.  Who's psyched??  I've also got tickets to go see Die Fantastischen Vier (they're like the German Beastie Boys) and then Die Ärzte (German punk band from Berlin) in November.  And next month is Wir Sind Helden in Berlin, woohoo!  (Alex, I'll be sure to take pictures and send them to you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/Rsc08RbeJjI/AAAAAAAAABQ/UkyY1Nl1hb0/s1600-h/IMG_4750.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 290px; height: 217px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/Rsc08RbeJjI/AAAAAAAAABQ/UkyY1Nl1hb0/s320/IMG_4750.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5100103313095796274" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, does anyone know someone who lives in Köln that needs a roommate starting October 1?  I get to look for my own apartment, but I have to live with Germans and my program needs to approve of it.  I don't have any desire to do it really, but I know in the end, it'll work out.  This year is probably going to fly by, especially considering that I've been here for 3 weeks.  (Yeah, I'm not writing very clearly...I'll admit it...German television is distracting...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and check out my pictures &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/7152228122210055301/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=7152228122210055301&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7152228122210055301'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7152228122210055301'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2007/08/im-not-dead-yet.html' title='I&apos;m Not Dead Yet...'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://bp3.blogger.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/Rsc0SBbeJiI/AAAAAAAAABI/DrGLk26Rf0U/s72-c/IMG_0408.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-4070146326303230810</id><published>2007-08-08T15:13:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2007-08-08T15:17:08.535+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Finally, a real blog entry from Köln</title><content type='html'>I typed this entry the other night at home because I have no internet, but yes.  Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the solution to not having internet at home is to write my blog entries at home on Word and then copying and pasting it.  And so, I write at home.  Unfortunately, Flickr seems to load rather slowly when I attempt to upload photos.  I suppose they will have to wait until I find a day when the internet is not so slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived here in Germany on a beautiful day.  The people with me, those who will be in Köln for the first two months of this program doing the language course, were all exhausted when we got to Bonn and saw the InWEnt headquarters.  InWEnt is the company that runs the program here in Germany.  We all attempted to stay awake, had a little breakfast, and chatted a little, eager to move on to our home for the next two months rather than listening to a boring video that was quickly putting us to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ride to Köln from Bonn was tough; I tried not to sleep because I knew if I did, it would be difficult to wake up and not be groggy or grumpy.  I managed to do so, although many other people took the time to take naps.  I can’t really say what we did when we got to Köln because it all happened rather quickly, but at the time, it couldn’t have gone any slower.  At around 4 pm, we were finally put in shared taxis and sent to our guest families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guest mother, Barbara, is a very friendly, 68 year old woman with two daughters that live separately in Köln.  To say the least, she is a hippie.  Not the let’s-smoke-up-and-believe-in-free-love type of hippie.  The first thing she said to me when I arrived was, “Oh!  How wonderful of you to show up!  Let’s sit outside and enjoy the sun!”  She’s more of a I-really-enjoy-life-and-do-everything-and-love-the-earth-and-wear-really-flowy-dresses type of hippie.  She makes jewelry that she sells in the market on occasion, claims not to be a smoker because she only smokes by herself in front of the TV late at night and ironically smokes Marlboro Reds, and has lots of stars and moons all over the place.  I think the best thing about living here is the lamp sitting in the window of the living room.  Barbara turns this lamp on every night and it’s shaped like a goose.  No joke.  I will try posting a picture of it (as well as the rest of important bits of the apartment) on here.  But it’s awesome.  Especially because the apartment is on the ground floor.  I’m sure anyone who walks by can definitely see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The language courses have not really begun yet, but we did take a placement test on our second day here in Köln.  We got our results today (as I write this, it is Monday, 6 August) and out of ten levels, I placed into the eighth.  I think there is only one person who got into a higher level and two other people, so I have heard, have also placed with me.  I think I can safely say I have a pretty advanced knowledge of German.  We will know our definite placements by the end of the week, so I may move up or down, as other people will, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to Berlin, Köln feels like a much smaller and more mainstream city.  There are fewer punks and fewer people wearing crazy, colorful outfits.  Köln also feels cleaner and less graffiti-ed, and perhaps due to this, appears less edgy.  It is, however, full of gay people.  When people say that Köln has a lot of gays, they weren’t lying.  It’s pretty cool because the city has an air of acceptance about it, similar to Berlin, but in a very different way that I cannot put into words.  Köln, like the German capital, is very multi-cultural (“multi-culti” as they say in German).  Yesterday there was a very large game against two Turkish soccer teams and it seemed like all the Turks in the city and beyond were on my train (which goes to the stadium here).  I have also noticed many more interracial couples, especially Asian girls with German guys.  I guess that seems to be the thing…?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a very different note, the people in my program are very diverse.  There are those who don’t speak a word of German and have never left their towns, those who are on the intermediate level and have visited, then the more advanced who have lived here.  Majors range from culinary arts, masonry, pre-law, business, and history.  I’m the only person actually doing film, though there are some other people doing “communications” or “media.”  I have gotten to know a good range of people that I am sure I will end up writing much about as the year goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the people I have met up with, I have seen Christian twice.  I went out to Düsseldorf and went to a party with him at his friend Stephan’s apartment.  I surprisingly knew several people because I had been there during Karneval: Sven, Oliver, “Ossi,” and Stephan.  The funniest moment had to have been when I was asking the difference between Altbier (the local Düsseldorfer beer) and Kölsch (the local Kölner beer).  It is important to understand a few key points about this moment beforehand.  First, Köln and Düsseldorf have always been rivals, much like the Yankees and the Red Sox, New York and Boston.  Second, Altbier is closer to ale, whereas Kölsch is more pils-like, mostly because Altbier, like its name indicates, is brewed longer.  Düsseldorfer do not like Kölsch and Kölner do not like Altbier.  When this super old man from Düsseldorf was explaining the difference between the two beers, he claimed, “Lass ein Pils eine Stunde stehen lassen und dann wird es ein Kölsch.”  Translation: Let a pilsner beer sit for an hour and it will become a Kölsch.  I think this is only funny if you really know what I’m talking about.  So if you come to the Rhineland, try both Altbier and Kölsch.  For now, I prefer Altbier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in Düsseldorf gave me the chance to see where Christian grew up.  It’s a really cute town that’s actually a part of the city of Düsseldorf, but it has cows, sheep, and cornfields.  You can look it up on Google Earth; it’s called Kaiserswerth.  I also got to meet Christian’s parents, both of whom are very friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve actually gotten to this point of this blog entry, congratulations.  I don’t expect anyone to actually get this far, but so much has happened in the first week that I don’t think I can actually write everything.  I also don’t want to bore you to tears, so I will stop here.  But as I’ve said, I don’t have internet at home, so updating my blog frequently these first two months is not going to happen.  I’ll try updating at least once a week.  Until then…bring it on, Cologne!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/4070146326303230810/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=4070146326303230810&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4070146326303230810'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4070146326303230810'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2007/08/finally-real-blog-entry-from-kln.html' title='Finally, a real blog entry from Köln'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-117650381398151810</id><published>2007-04-14T00:14:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2007-04-14T00:36:53.996+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Going Back to Germany</title><content type='html'>Another long period has passed when I have not updated my blog.  However, I feel like it would be appropriate to do so now.  The title of this entry, "Going Back to Germany" has two significant meanings:  1.  I was in Berlin for spring break and 2.  I am officially going back to Germany after graduation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/199/445380834_a28d8f59c2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 204px; height: 273px;" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/199/445380834_a28d8f59c2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex and I went back to Berlin for spring break&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/186/445380472_c1d5d3f1d3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 199px; height: 148px;" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/186/445380472_c1d5d3f1d3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it was a good time.  We did everything we hadn't done, like finding the rest of the Deutsches Historisches Museum, going clubbing (Alex hadn't really done much while we were there), and trying to get into the Reichstag (Alex had also not done that).  We even got into a slight brawl in the middle of Skalitzer Straße over by Schlesisches Tor.  I kept bunching Alex and well, she took her revenge by taking me down.  I was just so shocked that she was actually attacking me that I automatically gave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/240/445380756_7644d5751e.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 234px; height: 183px;" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/240/445380756_7644d5751e.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The weather was gorgeous while we were there, especially in comparison to the cloudy, rainy/snowy stuff we're having here at the moment in Vermont.  We did a lot of walking like we used to.  We even walked through Tiergarten with our iPods turned on, not talking to each other.  (Yeah, it's a sign of our generation.)  We also went to the EU's 50th birthday party in front of the Brandenburg Gate, although the party there did not even come close to anything that had happened during the World Cup.  Oh, and we saw the polar bear cub, Knut, which was absolutely ridiculous.  Germany loves its bears.  Seriously.  First, there was Bruno.  Then there was Knut.  And then the panda bear Yan Yan died.  Oh, bears.  Stephen Colbert would hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to Berlin was also a good time because I got to see all the people that I knew there before, like Christian's friends, Pablo (he came up from Köln for the weekend), and Devin.  (Devin is still kicking in Berlin with her band, &lt;a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;amp;friendid=66764547"&gt;Italoporno&lt;/a&gt;)  It was as if I had never left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reason why this entry is titled "Going Back to Germany" is because I got a call this morning informing me that I was taken off the Alternate list for this scholarship, the &lt;a href="http://www.cbyx.net/"&gt;Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Program &lt;/a&gt;(CBYX), and actually chosen to participate.  It was rather funny because the call woke me up, which is also interesting since I never leave my cell phone on.  Last night, however, I forgot to turn it off.  Anyway, the call woke me up but as soon as the woman on the phone said, "There's an open slot for the CBYX program.  Do you want it?" I was pretty much wide awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that settles it.  Next year I will be somewhere in Germany (I don't know where exactly yet) starting on August 1.  I'll be studying for 6 months and then doing an internship for 6 months.  I'm not allowed to travel back to the U.S. for Christmas or anything like that, which for me doesn't really make much of a difference, so that means everyone's going to have to come visit me.  And now the senioritis can kick in for real.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/117650381398151810/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=117650381398151810&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/117650381398151810'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/117650381398151810'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2007/04/going-back-to-germany.html' title='Going Back to Germany'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://farm1.static.flickr.com/199/445380834_a28d8f59c2_t.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-117262007277907167</id><published>2007-02-28T00:31:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2007-02-28T00:47:52.790+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>I'm done with my thesis!</title><content type='html'>I am officially done with my thesis.  Forever.  I did my defense for it today, thought I screwed up, but Joanna (my thesis advisor) told me later in her class that they're leaving the grade as it was.  The defense did not lower the grade in any way, shape, or form.  What a process it's been...but I never once got stressed out about it.  (Thank God I have time management skills in which if I do anything late, I am just incapable of doing anything at all, and hence why I work really far ahead.)  The fact that I am done with my thesis defense now means that I can actually have a little bit of senioritis and not feel guilty.  Well, not quite.  I just have to maintain my GPA (should be easy enough) and maybe find a job. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after doing the defense and knowing my grade is not going to change, this means that I'm going to be graduating with high honors (I think that might be magna cum laude, no?), hopefully.  That is, if nothing gets screwed up.  (Such as they suddenly change the GPA minimum on me or I fail miserably in the one class I need for the semester).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now the job search begins...I actually sent out another job application today for my dream job (that is, if that included the fact that it's in L.A.).  Hopefully I'll get an interview with them.  We'll see.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/117262007277907167/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=117262007277907167&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/117262007277907167'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/117262007277907167'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2007/02/im-done-with-my-thesis.html' title='I&apos;m done with my thesis!'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-116309253145422924</id><published>2006-11-09T18:07:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2006-11-10T03:02:01.716+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Sounds of Silence</title><content type='html'>After just eating lunch with some friends, I've noticed that I have nothing new to say to people...ever.  I told Alex how I felt and she's right; it's a complete overexposure to the people I am friends with because we all live together.  Topic conversations are pretty much limited to the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Schoolwork &amp; how much it sucks.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Your weekend plans.&lt;br /&gt;3.  How tired you are and how much you want to nap.&lt;br /&gt;4.  What you've already done for the day, what your plans are for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Ideas for parties sometime in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that's a pretty comprehensive list of topics.  To be perfectly honest, I'd rather sit in silence and enjoy it rather than chit chatting about stuff that I'll re-hash out with someone else later.  For example, this morning I was repeating stuff that I had told Elise already on Tuesday.  I felt stupid, so just apologized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/109/293434449_03aa1eaae3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/109/293434449_03aa1eaae3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like that is one thing I learned while I was abroad.  It's OK to sit in silence with someone and not have it awkward.  Why is it that we're so used to constantly talking?  Why can't we just sit and say nothing?  I don't understand it.  Elise also told me that every third word out of my mouth is "thesis," which she's probably right about, but I have nothing else to say except, "Hmm, I should go work on my thesis," or something along those lines.  Nothing in my life is currently that interesting.  There is nothing new to report to people, nothing newsworthy.  I feel like I myself am just a boring person at the moment because all I do is eat, sleep, exercise, go to class, and do classwork.  How monotonous.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/116309253145422924/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=116309253145422924&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/116309253145422924'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/116309253145422924'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/11/sounds-of-silence.html' title='The Sounds of Silence'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-116181784120151513</id><published>2006-10-25T22:49:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2006-10-26T01:10:41.266+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Back in the U.S. (of A)</title><content type='html'>So I haven't updated my blog in awhile for many reasons.  The main reason is that I left Berlin on September 3 (the Wir Sind Helden concert was cancelled and I was livid), came back Stateside, was at home in Jersey for a week, then came up to Middlebury.  Since being at Middlebury, I've been thrown back into the world of academia, stress, and social obligations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm actually only taking two classes (Reasonable Doubts, a.k.a. German course about the Enlightenment and reading classic texts like &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Faust&lt;/span&gt; and then my senior film seminar about Fellini &amp; Antonioni) and my thesis.  It leaves me a nice schedule with classes only on Tuesday and Thursday, as well as Wednesday evening.  I work in the mailroom Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in order to earn money so I can get back to Berlin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which, I will be going back to Berlin in March for spring break with Alex.  You may be asking yourself, "Already?" And the answer is YES.  I still am not sure if I love it here as much as I once did, hence booking a flight already to go back.  By "here" I mean the U.S. in general, but I also definitely mean Middlebury.  Middlebury is not what it once was.  It is no longer my home away from home.  It is no longer a place where I feel comfortable as I had been.  It has become a place where I have to be in order to continue on with the rest of my life.  It is basically just a pause in my life, the life that I discovered while I was in Berlin and the life that I want to get back to.  I am obligated to be back here, to get that piece of paper saying I went to college, to finish my studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being back has also made me realize I am taking a new direction with my life.  That direction is steering me back towards Germany.  I feel like I was much happier there with the lifestyle and who I was, who I became.  I don't like the people here as I did before I went abroad.  Things have changed, people have changed, I don't know any of the underclassmen.  (Not that I really care because I just go to the dining hall whenever I please, not caring if I'm alone.)  Relationships have evolved: I see that people I once cared about, I now couldn't care less about, people I once barely knew have become better friends, and people I never knew seem to be better friends than those I thought would always be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing really excites me about studying anymore.  It makes me irritated to have to sit down and read a text about a film.  I think the only thing I'm vaguely interested in is my thesis, only because it is my own project and I can do what I want with it.  It's rather sad, but I suppose this is one of the changes in myself that has happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a completely different note, my oldest sister Tracie got married a few weeks ago.  That was a real jolt.  I suppose it was a sign of growing up, of letting go.  Tracie will always be there, of course, but "letting go" of childhood, of silly jokes, of immaturity.  It's hard to explain because obviously those things will still be there, but it's not the same.  Don't get me wrong, I love my um, brother-in-law, I think he's awesome.  It's just strange to think Tracie as a married woman.  (I think that's it:  She's a married &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;woman,&lt;/span&gt; not a girl anymore...who the hell is ever called a "married girl" anyway?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that is my life in a nutshell thus far.  I plan on applying for jobs to get back to Germany.  I hope that I will be there again someday soon.  Right after college would be nice.  But yes...getting out of Middlebury will be a great relief, as much as I will miss it.  It will be a place that I will always remember, but right now, I am ready to move on.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/116181784120151513/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=116181784120151513&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/116181784120151513'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/116181784120151513'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/10/back-in-us-of.html' title='Back in the U.S. (of A)'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-115565851629566231</id><published>2006-08-15T17:21:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2006-08-15T18:15:16.633+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Reflections on a Year Abroad</title><content type='html'>Yes, indeed, I haven't updated this blog in quite awhile.  Between this entry and the last, things that have happened:  I turned 21, went to Munich with Ashley, the World Cup came to an end (with Italy winning the title, unfortunately, but nonetheless, Germany put up a good fight), the end of the semester (had to write 3 papers, 1 exam), went to Croatia with Ashley for a week and tanned, and most of my friends have left for home already. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the fact that hardly anyone is left (with the exceptions of Cam and Zoey who are both busy anyway), I have had much time to myself between research for my thesis and napping to reflect upon this year and how I have changed.  For one, I am not looking forward to going home as much as one would think I would be.  Instead, I think I'm more upset about the fact that I have to leave this wonderful city and go back to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;really&lt;/span&gt; studying (ie: classes meeting more than once a week for only 1.5 hours at a time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year has been a life changing experience to put it simply.  I have learned much about myself: I am more independent than I thought so, my academic limits were pushed (writing academic papers in German, anyone?), I'm more open to new experiences (drum 'n bass, foods, beer), and I have a passion for Fußball (um, soccer).  I think the independence factor is what surprised me the most.  Looking back, finding an apartment was probably one of the most challenging things I've done, but look how well that turned out.  I made friends through and with them, had tons of fun, learned tons of vocabulary (very useful stuff, too, like, "Es geht mir auf die Eier!"), and had help on papers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not quite sure what I will miss most about Berlin.  Drinking beer on the street.  The U-bahn announcement, "Einsteigen, bitte.  Zurückbleiben, bitte."  The annoying street musicians on the U- and S-bahn.  The Turkish market on Tuesdays and Fridays.  The dogs running around without leashes.  The nightlife...And then there are the specific people and places that I will miss, like my roommates, the Oberbaum Brücke, Rosi's, crazy Julian (although I haven't seen him in awhile), Görlitzer Park, Wannsee.  Going back to Middlebury will be a huge change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to choose ten songs to represent this year, I know what they'd be.  Of course, many of them are World Cup songs, but it played such a prominent role during second semester.  (Hence why I had to stress out at the end of the semester to finish my papers on time because I watched 58 of the 64 games)  I would choose these songs, but not in any specific order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Wir Sind Helden - "Nur ein Wort"&lt;br /&gt;2.  Sportfreunde Stiller - "'54, '74, '90, 2006" (or 2010, both versions)&lt;br /&gt;3.  Nena - "99 Luftballons"&lt;br /&gt;4.  Bob Sinclair - "Love Generation"&lt;br /&gt;5.  Seeed - "Ding"&lt;br /&gt;6.  Oliver Pocher - "Schwarz und Weiß"&lt;br /&gt;7.  Texas Lightning - "No No Never"&lt;br /&gt;8.  Tocotronic - "Meine Freundin und ihr Freund"&lt;br /&gt;9.  Farin Urlaub - "Zehn"&lt;br /&gt;10.  Franz Ferdinand - "Do You Want To"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, I've actually made a playlist on my iPod like I do every year and it has 40 some odd songs in German and English.  I know that when I hear these songs all together, it will remind me of the times I've had here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I am leaving in 2.5 weeks, I know I will be back.  I've already started looking for jobs here in Berlin for after college (if anyone knows of any job in the music or film/TV industry here, drop me a line.) and hopefully it will be just as much fun, if not more so.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/115565851629566231/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=115565851629566231&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/115565851629566231'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/115565851629566231'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/08/reflections-on-year-abroad.html' title='Reflections on a Year Abroad'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-115282150310174340</id><published>2006-07-13T21:58:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2006-10-26T15:26:06.003+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>'54, '74, '90, 2010 + München</title><content type='html'>Now that the World Cup is officially over, it seems like I have absolutely nothing to do with my life.  I'm estimating that I saw between 52 and 58 of the 64 games that happened between June 9th and July 9th.  As you can see, I became slightly addicted (ok, "slightly" is an understatement) to football.  To say the least, I now have a bigger appreciation for the sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the quarter-finals, Germany beat Argentina in a penalty shoot-out after overtime.  I'll admit it: I was pretty nervous the day of the game because I felt that Argentina had a better chance of moving on.  After making all of their penalty shots, it felt like the whole country broke out into one huge party that would continue until the semi-final game.  We all know how the semi-final ended.  Germany unfortunately lost to Italy (who plays dirtier than flies on a pile of poo) in the last two minutes of overtime.  If only they had held out, they probably could've beat the Italians in a penalty shoot-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, Germany managed to place third after beating Portugal in a game that was probably better and more interesting than the final itself.  Third isn't bad at all, considering there were 32 teams at the beginning of the World Cup.  And the Germans have acknowledged that, praising their team, thanking Jürgen Klinsmann (the coach), and essentially, being a graceful third place winner.  On the day of the final, the whole team came to Berlin to the Fan Mile in front of Brandenburger Tor to thank their fans.  Ashley, Mike, and I went because we all have our favorite players (Podolski, Friedrich, and Ballack, respectively) and thought it would be a once in a lifetime thing.  Indeed, it was, but it was hot as all hell.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/115282150310174340/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=115282150310174340&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/115282150310174340'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/115282150310174340'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/07/54-74-90-2010-mnchen.html' title='&apos;54, &apos;74, &apos;90, 2010 + München'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-115109501031798490</id><published>2006-06-23T22:03:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2006-06-29T18:24:28.813+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Berlin, Berlin, Wir fahren nach Berlin</title><content type='html'>Unless you live in the United States or under a rock (or as they say in German, "hinter dem Mond leben"), you would be aware that the biggest sporting event in the world is currently happening right here in Germany. This sporting event is this phenomenon called the "World Cup" (Fußball Weltmeisterschaft in German, or WM for short). As an American, I never thought that I would get completely absorbed into the football culture outside our dear, dear country, but oh Lord. My life in the past two weeks has been taken over by football, football, football.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/51/177765986_5f92ad04e0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 243px; height: 182px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/51/177765986_5f92ad04e0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The opening game was June 9 and was Germany against Costa Rica. Since then, I have watched about 40 of the 45 games that have already happened. You think I'm kidding, but I'm not. Three games a day until this past Tuesday and living with Germans that are really into it...well, I've found myself wasting away in front of the TV. However, I'd like to point out that the Germany vs. Poland game was simply amazing (only goal made in the last minute of overtime? Awesome), the goal that Joe Cole made in the England vs. Sweden match was fantastic, and it's a pity that the US is out of the Round of 16. (But Beasley is still the man.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ashley and I have decided that we are in favor of Germany winning (naturally). We also have "claimed" German players...meaning, we've dubbed them hot. She likes Podolwski and I like Ballack. We've been typical women sometimes; we watch the games and comment on how hot players are. I do that with Heike as well, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The atmosphere here in Berlin is indescribable, but I'll try to explain it: Electrifying. Exciting. Loud. Energetic. Crazy. Chaotic. You get the point. There are fans from every corner of the world coming to enjoy the atmosphere, whether or not they have tickets to games. Every restaurant and cafe (or almost every) has a TV on which customers can view the games whenever they're on. And when games aren't on? Customers can still watch commentary on past games or predictions on who will win the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the excess amount of TVs &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/47/177759994_98fb4be2fa.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 250px; height: 187px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/47/177759994_98fb4be2fa.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;everywhere (including huge Jumbotrons at major sites like Brandenburger Tor and Treptower Park), the German patriotism is unbelievable. I don't think I've ever seen this many German flags before in my life. They're on cars, buildings, shirts, people's faces, the U- and S-bahn. Everywhere you look, you can see Schwarz-Rot-Gold. In Der Spiegel (a magazine equivalent to Time), there was an article saying that the German flag is sold out nearly everywhere and production in China is having a tough time keeping up with the demand. Additionally, four times as many Deutscher Fußballbund jerseys have been sold as in the last World Cup in 2002.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/54/177758979_e85d09c5e0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 252px; height: 189px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/54/177758979_e85d09c5e0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I've been to various screenings of various games. For the US vs. Italy game, I went to the Brandenburger Tor Fan Mile with a few other Americans: Mike, Dan, Drew (visiting from Tübingen), and some of Drew's friends. We were in a vast sea of Italian fans who didn't understand Dan yelling profanities. However, Drew and Dan understood the Italians whenever they said anything about us. I also sat in Treptower Park and watched the Brazil vs. Australia game, as well as South Korea vs. France. Yesterday I went to see the US vs. Ghana and Czech Republic vs. Italy game there, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, today was probably a highlight of the whole WM experience for me. I had tickets to the Tunisia vs. Ukraine game and Hugo came with me. It was pretty exciting and you could feel the tension in the air. The Olympic Stadium was completely full with the 72,000 spectators chanting, screaming, booing, and clapping. Unfortunately only one goal was made by the Ukrainians (number 7 Shevchenko) and the game could've been more exciting, but I can't complain. How many people can say they went to a World Cup game during their study abroad year? (Besides Ashley and Cam, I'm sure others can, but still...that's not my point.) I don't know what else to say, but it was definitely more fun than the hockey game I saw in Turin for the Olympics. (Even if I saw my own home team there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/49/177764907_549fd1394b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 256px; height: 192px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/49/177764907_549fd1394b.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My support currently is with the German team for many obvious reasons. They play again tomorrow against the Swedes, which should make for a thrilling game. Tomorrow I'm also turning the big 2-1, but how anticlimactic since I can already legally drink here. I can even drink on the street! But even so, I think I will celebrate by watching some more football...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, "Berlin, Berlin, wir fahren nach Berlin" means "Berlin, Berlin, we're going to Berlin." The Germans keep saying that, but other teams have their translations too. I've heard "¡Berlin, Berlin, vamos a Berlin!" and others, which I'm sure is the same. Who will make the final? God only knows, and I can only look forward to July 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this later with pictures at some other point...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/115109501031798490/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=115109501031798490&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/115109501031798490'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/115109501031798490'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/06/berlin-berlin-wir-fahren-nach-berlin.html' title='Berlin, Berlin, Wir fahren nach Berlin'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-114984892999239926</id><published>2006-06-09T11:45:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2006-06-09T12:28:50.013+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>"The Irish Sea is crap!"</title><content type='html'>It's been yet another long while since I have updated my blog, but Dan just recently made his big trip around Europe and came to visit. Before that, I was working diligently on one of my papers and have completed 10 pages already. Just another 2 pages and 2 more papers to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/64/160828335_fca83edeff.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/64/160828335_fca83edeff.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dan got here to Berlin on the 30th. We didn't do too much before we left for a nice 4 day trip to Dublin. When people said that Dublin was expensive, they weren't lying. Even so, it was a nice break from Germany, German, and Germans. The first day we got there, we went to Phoenix Park, saw the Wellington Memorial, watched some Irish people playing football in the park, and went to the Guinness Factory. Everyone who visits the Guinness Factory gets a complimentary pint, and oh, did we drink it. We actually went and drank our pints first and then did the tour, only because the bar was closing early. My verdict: I still don't like Guinness. It's too thick and it's like eating a loaf of bread or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dinner, we decided on this restaurant in Temple Bar &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/45/160831468_b8d1256ebf.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 296px; height: 223px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/45/160831468_b8d1256ebf.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;serving traditional Irish boxties, which are these potato pancakes with stuff wrapped up inside. It was incredible and rather expensive, but completely worth it. As we were finishing up our dessert, a familiar face came up to us and said, "Hey guys, what's up?" It was none other than Mark Hemley, our friend from Middlebury whom we haven't seen since leaving the States. (So about August or so?) He was so casual about seeing us, saying, "I knew I was going to see you guys today! I thought I saw a guy that looked just like you, Dan, and I thought I would run into you." The weird thing was that Dan and I didn't know that Mark was going to be in Dublin, and he didn't know we were going to be, either. What are the chances that we run into each other in a little restaurant in Dublin? Dan and I were completely shocked beyond belief to see Mark, but he passed it off as if it were another day in Middlebury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He and his girlfriend were just getting their dinner as we finished, so we decided to meet up an hour later. Mark's girlfriend didn't end up coming, so the three of us went to the nearest Irish pub, grabbed some pints (which were expensive), and then headed over to the Temple Bar. (The actual pub named Temple Bar) Mark and his girlfriend were only in Dublin that night and were travelling around Ireland after that, but it was nonetheless really amazing to have run into him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day we went to the Irish Writers' Museum (well, we had to because of our Contemporary Ireland class!), took a tour of Dublin Castle, and then saw St. Patrick's Cathedral. Somehow it ended up taking up the whole day, but we also did a lot of walking. In fact, we didn't take buses anywhere while in Dublin. We just walked everywhere, even though we were staying rather far from places like the Guinness Storehouse and Jameson Distillery. The weather was incredible and we figured we'd save a little money by walking. Not only that, but getting exercise is always good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/63/160843403_a39b8f178e.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 196px; height: 263px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/63/160843403_a39b8f178e.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On Saturday, we took a guided tour outside of Dublin called "The Celtic Experience." A bit cheesy, I suppose, but it was a great way to see the Irish countryside. Our tourguide, Paul, was really knowledgeable and really had the art of Irish storytelling down pat. He was pretty funny, too. The best lines were when he said that the Irish Catholics are the "guiltiest people on Earth" and then compared Jesus to Communism. (Long story, but just think of how an Irishman might do it. That's how he told it.) He also informed us that on any day when you're looking out of your window, you can see at least 40 different shades of green in the Irish countryside. I wonder how many there are in Vermont?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour only had 14 people total and it was very private, very personal. We got to see a whole bunch of places whose names I can't remember, but that's why a digital camera is so useful. If you go to my pictures &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee/sets/72157594156265486/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the labels for each place. I took pictures of each place's name so I could remember because I know my memory sucks. There was a family from Texas there and they were so ridiculously Texan, but in a good way. It was kind of amusing since I've been away from Americans for so long, and it was really refreshing to just be with people who are so obviously American but not obnoxiously so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/78/160845659_38bb6671e6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 244px; height: 198px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/78/160845659_38bb6671e6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The tour lasted the entire day and when we got back into Dublin, there were a bunch of rubber ducks in the Liffey River. The World Record Duck Race had taken place earlier in the day. Children and adults can pay about 5€ a piece for a rubber duck with a number. &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/52/160849311_0b134eaca9.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 274px; height: 205px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/52/160849311_0b134eaca9.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All of the rubber ducks go floating down the Liffey, and the one to get to the end wins a big prize of some sort. There must've been at least 100,000 rubber ducks and you could just see a sea of yellow. Because the race was done, people were collecting rubber ducks and throwing them up to people standing along the river. Dan and I each managed to snag one, although I told him I'll probably end up throwing it out someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our last day in Dublin was spent at the Jameson Distillery, where, much like in the Guinness Storehouse, we got complimentary whiskey. We went a little early so we were drinking whiskey at about noon or so. My verdict: Still don't like whiskey much, either. Then we took a DART train out to Howth, which is this town that is still in County Dublin, but on the edge of the Irish Sea. There were beaches and steep cliffs, lots of Irish children running around. It was a really beautiful day to go out there and we climbed some of the cliffs, walked out to the lighthouse, and listened in on conversations. Our favorite, by far, was between an 8- or 9-year old boy and his younger 5- or 6-year old sister. You could tell that their parents had planned a weekend family excursion and the little boy just didn't really want to be there. On the other hand, the little girl was completely enchanted by it. This is how the exchange went:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little boy: The Irish Sea is crap!&lt;br /&gt;Little girl:  No, it's not!  It's full of sharks and stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/61/160850634_8160fe54f8.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 255px; height: 191px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/61/160850634_8160fe54f8.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yes, it's a short exchange, but imagine it with little Irish accents and the two of them just being very blunt with each other. Another good one was when a little boy, perched upon his father's shoulders, dropped some sort of lid for some snack he had. Here's that exchange:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little boy:  I don't need it.&lt;br /&gt;Father:  Well, you need to put it in a bin, dontchya?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it was probably much funnier when we were there because of the accents. We also decided that the Irish seem to be very matter-of-fact with each other. But mainly, it was probably because of the accents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We flew back here to Berlin at the asscrack of dawn (our flight left Dublin at 5:55 a.m.). The weather was not so great when we left: foggy, gray, cool. Paul had told us that we had lucked out because before we showed up, there had been about 3 months straight of rain. Dan actually had gotten sunburned on his face and I got a "driving" tan. (My left arm was tanned, while my right was not) Who would've thought in Ireland?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our time here in Berlin was pretty laid back. When we got back on Monday, the Karneval der Kulturen was still going on over by Hallesches Tor. It was basically another street festival with all the minorities celebrating their cultures. Other things we did included going to the Museum für Naturkünde (Natural History Museum), but unfortunately they were restoring the huge dinosaur hall. Therefore, we weren't able to see the world famous brachiosaurus skeleton. On Wednesday, there was a huge fan party for the World Cup in front of the Brandenburger Tor and we went to that with Ashley and Dan. There was a country band from Mississippi that played a bunch of covers (including a country rendition of "Hey, ya!" but it worked). Ashley and I were having a lot of dancing but I think all the people around us thought we were completely nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess there isn't much else noteworthy to tell...the details here are vague, yes. I really don't feel like writing every little thing, but if you want to see pictures from Dublin, I took about 200 or so. (Oh, the joys of digital) So, go to my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee/sets/72157594156265486/"&gt;Flickr page&lt;/a&gt;, check them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is the opening game for the World Cup with Germany playing against Costa Rica. Dan left today to go back home (with a short stop in London), so I will be going to see the game with Christian, Heike, and a bunch of his friends. It should be really exciting because Germany has a really good chance of winning, and well, it's the opening game. Opening game, host team playing...what could be better?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/114984892999239926/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=114984892999239926&amp;isPopup=true' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/114984892999239926'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/114984892999239926'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/06/irish-sea-is-crap.html' title='&quot;The Irish Sea is crap!&quot;'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-114736242303538017</id><published>2006-05-11T16:34:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2006-05-11T17:47:03.120+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Mein Neuer Zimmer (und Neue Mitbewohnerin)</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/1600/IMG_2485.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 278px; height: 208px;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/320/IMG_2485.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As the title of this entry indicates, I have a new room and a new roommate. No, I didn't move out of my apartment. Instead, I switched rooms. On April 30, Valentin (aka Das Phantom) moved out, I switched into Valentin/Pablo's room (which actually belongs to Krischan), and Heike moved back. Here's the complicated story: I was subletting Heike's room because she had to go to Koblenz to do some sort of law course. Pablo was subletting Krischan's room, but moved out at the end of February because Krischan was supposed to come back from doing a semester abroad in Austria. However, Krischan got an internship in Bavaria (southern Germany) and didn't come back at the end of February. Pablo didn't want to stay, so moved in with his friend Julian, while Christian and I found another subletter, Valentin (das Phantom/der Vampir/Rasputin), for two months. We didn't communicate with Valentin at all, or rather, he didn't talk to us. Hence all the funny nicknames. At the end of the two months, so the end of April, Valentin moved out, I moved into Krischan's room, and Heike is back into where I was sleeping. And now the apartment consists of Heike, Christian, and me. Complicated, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make things simpler, I am in&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/1600/IMG_2486.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 298px; height: 224px;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/320/IMG_2486.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a new room and got a new roommate. I really like Heike and the dynamic of the apartment has changed completely from when Pablo was here. Two guys and a girl is very different from two girls and a guy. For one, I am no longer "self-made bitch" as Alex called me. Heike washes the dishes more than I do, probably cleans a little more than I do, and cooks as much as I do. She baked an Apfelkuchen (apple cake) for Christian's birthday while I did nothing. You can also tell the difference between our ages: She bought Christian a cookbook and I got him the new Chili Peppers CD. The apartment has skewed older now, too, (Heike is 30, Christian is 27, Pablo is 22), although Heike doesn't seem like she's 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/47/139305498_f434761fed.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 206px; height: 276px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/47/139305498_f434761fed.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I also didn't update about Tag der Arbeit (Labor Day) on 1 May, which is famous for demonstrations and riots. This year was no different. The day before, I went out with some friends and we just relaxed in Viktoriapark over by Mehringdamm. By "relaxing," I mean drank large amounts of alcohol while listening to people playing guitar, watching people play with fire, and enjoying the spring weather. I didn't go anywhere else really after Viktoriapark because I admittedly drank myself silly, but apparently there were other things going on in the city, like in Mauerpark in Prenzlauerberg (where the first stone is traditionally thrown) and Boxhagener Platz in Friedrichshain. (The picture on the left is our "Workers of the World Unite!" picture from Monday)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Monday, 1 May, there was this huge &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/46/139312162_a527446e54.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 280px; height: 210px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/46/139312162_a527446e54.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;street festival outside my apartment on Oranienstraße called MyFest. The festival went all the way down to Oranienplatz, extended to Mariannenplatz, and was also in Heinrichplatz and Adalbertstraße. I suppose this doesn't mean anything to those who have never been to Berlin, especially Kreuzberg, but it's a pretty sizeable area. There were bands of all types playing for MyFest, from traditional Russian music to hardcore ska and punk bands. The streets were full of people drinking beer, eating döner and falafel, singing, dancing, and enjoying the spring weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went and enjoyed the day with Zoey, Mike, and Ashley. Mike was wearing a Blaumann, which are these bright blue overalls that construction workers and such wear, with an orange t-shirt. It was pretty ridiculous but made him it easy to find him in the crowds. We saw many bands, ate falafel, sat on the street and people watched, and sat in the park. It was a good day, but unfortunately I had to leave early to go see a film for my Taiwanese film class. When I came back to Kreuzberg at around 11 pm, the party was still going on. Apparently, the festivities went on til 1 am, but Christian and I didn't notice because we were watching Armageddon on TV til 2.&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/45/139308068_7033476f24.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 261px; height: 196px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/45/139308068_7033476f24.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Throughout the day, there were demonstrations going on for every little thing you could possibly think of: People against domestic violence, against the Iraq War, Communists demonstrated, there were some demonstrators for anarchy, etc. etc. I didn't partake in anything. Ashley, Zoey, Mike, and Dan were out very late at night while I had come home, and apparently the riot police were right outside my apartment on Oranienstraße trying to control people and a huge bonfire, according to what they said. The funny thing is that the next day, everything was back in order and it looked as if the previous day had never happened. Another reason to love Germany: Things get cleaned up fast after a huge party like MyFest or Karneval. And every day I still come to the conclusion that I'm so glad I came to Berlin for my year abroad.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/114736242303538017/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=114736242303538017&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/114736242303538017'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/114736242303538017'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/05/mein-neuer-zimmer-und-neue.html' title='Mein Neuer Zimmer (und Neue Mitbewohnerin)'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-114581487539334285</id><published>2006-04-23T19:50:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2006-04-25T21:39:44.513+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Sommersemester Woche 1, Drew Visits, &amp; Die Wannsee</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/53/134091092_da4420ddb9.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 275px; height: 207px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/53/134091092_da4420ddb9.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Whenever I don't update for awhile, one of two things usually happens.  First, absolutely nothing happens.  Literally, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;nothing&lt;/span&gt;.  Orelse the time flies by, I've done so much, and I just don't know where to start.  This time, the latter has happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up quickly, my friend Drew from language school came up to visit from Tübingen (near Stuttgart) last week. Last week was also the first week of classes for Sommersemester, which in English would just be known as second semester. On Sunday, Drew left and I went to the Wannsee for a picnic with Rob, Cam, Ashley, Dan, and some kids from Rob &amp; Cam's program. That's the short version of events. Read on if you want to know the longer version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Drew came up on a whim and didn't know &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/56/134090881_cfa0cdd9bb.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 262px; height: 196px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/56/134090881_cfa0cdd9bb.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;when exactly he was leaving. So I let him stay. During the day, I would go to a few classes and then come back. On Wednesday evening, we went with Ashley to see Dropkick Murphys and Less than Jake in concert. It was pretty chaotic, to say the least. We were up front for Less than Jake and the crowd went wild. We were moshing and ska-dancing around, so much so that I basically pushed Drew over (even though he's at least 5 inches taller than me) and broke my bra. Yes, people, I broke my bra from moshing and yes, it was a first for me. Hey, it happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We moved to the back for Dropkick Murphys because you could feel the anxiety in the air to just go crazy. We were pretty beaten up from Less than Jake, and not to mention that there was a creepy bald guy trying to hit on Ashley and me by staring at us with a look he probably thought was seductive. (It was just plain creepy.) The acoustics were pretty crappy, but even so, I sang along to "The Workers' Song" and "Barroom Hero," amongst others. Stiny, if you're reading this: I wish you had been there! You would've had so much fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/51/134091533_bf736683e9.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 280px; height: 210px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/51/134091533_bf736683e9.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On Friday evening, I chose a club in Prenzlauerberg, Icon, to go to because I had seen an advertisement saying that one of the guys from the Propellerheads was DJing. Ashley and Drew came with me and the selection of music was pretty good. It was electro, so it was a surprise to see Pablo with his friends Alex and David. Sure, I had invited them to come with us, but I didn't expect them to go. Pablo always goes to drum &amp; bass parties, which, unsurprisingly, he went to afterward. Anyway, that was basically Drew's visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Last week was also the first week of classes. I realized that I'm not as stressed out as last semester when I had to pick them out, and it's probably because I know the rules of the game. It was pretty funny today because Ashley, Cam, and Gergana (Mt. Holyoke student in the Midd Program) came to a Vorlesung (general lecture) that I went to last week. At the beginning of the class, the professor said that he had to speak to the one American student afterward. I was the only American student last week, all the others were Austrians. (Short digression: Can I just say, Austrians doing their 'abroad' year/semester in Germany is a little ridiculous? That'd be like Americans going to Canada for an 'abroad' experience.) Anyway, Ashley, Gergana, and I discussed writing a Klausur (written exam) for the course and Cam asked if he could take a 2 hour one. The professor said the Klausur would be around 45 minutes, so Cam can't take it (not enough for his program), and Gergana asked, "Wait, are we allowed to do that?" On the sheet we give to professors, it says the Klausur has to be 1 hour and a half long. I wanted to just nudge her really hard and say, "It doesn't matter!" I explained later that it doesn't matter because as long as we're writing a Klausur, the program director doesn't need to know the tiny little details. It'll say on paper that we did an exam and that's all that matters. It's learning the rules of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/55/134092199_8facaf5c44.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 211px; height: 282px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/55/134092199_8facaf5c44.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Dan on the jungle gym at the Wannsee.  No, he didn't knock little kids off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm almost done choosing classes...I'm definitely taking Massaker in der Frühen Neuzeit (Massacres in the Early New Time), Das Kino aus Taiwan (Taiwanese Cinema), and Geschichte der öffentlichen Kommunikation: Der Nationalsozialismus und die deutsche Gesellschaft (History of Open Communication: National-Socialism and Germany Society). Das Kino aus Taiwan is actually a Hauptseminar, a.k.a. graduate level course. However, it's being taught by an American, so his German is actually really easy for me to understand. Even so, I'm probably crazy for taking a grad level course in German!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing to mention is the trip to the Wannsee. Cam thought it would be a good idea to go out to the lake, have a picnic, play a little Fußball. That's exactly what we did. A bunch of students from his program came and Ashley, Dan, and I were there representing the Midd program. We played an impromptu game of Fußball (Ashley's shoes acting as one goal, two empty bottles of Beck's being the other), which was not too bad, considering most of us playing are American. The only Germans playing were Cam's roommates Anna and Joanna. However, some &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/44/134092289_144e14cc38.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 279px; height: 217px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/44/134092289_144e14cc38.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Turkish kids wanted to play with us, so we let them. They weren't half bad. It was really amusing, too, because Cam would urge them on, saying, "Ok, Ahmed!" and "Gut gemacht, Aqbar!" (however you spell it). Ashley thought he was being mean and making up names for them, when in reality, those were really those names. We also 'adopted' a German girl, Sammy, who was pretty brutal, and then a little German boy whose name I didn't hear. All in all, it was a very active day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this has to be the most scatterbrained entry I've written in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, but here's a joke that Ashley told me that I really enjoyed. But first, the background story to why it's so funny to me. A lot of Americans I know here have been adopting German grammar. In German, you would say, "Kommst du mit?" in order to say, "Are you coming?" However, the literal translation of that is "Are you coming with?" What I mean to say is, many of Americans are just tacking on prepositions to the ends of sentences and questions, where in German it would work. Obviously, it isn't grammatically correct in English. And now, the joke:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a prospectus walking around the Princeton campus, admiring the buildings and wandering. He wanted to know where the library was, so he stopped a student and asked, "Hey, do you know where the library's at?" The student blinked at him and replied, "Yes, I do. In the English language, ending sentences with prepositions is grammatically incorrect. I know where the library is." The prospectus paused a second and rephrased the question: "Do you know where the library's at, asshole?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ashley and I found this joke quite humorous because we're ending sentences with prepositions now and we both have a small dislike for Princeton. The End.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and sorry for all of the pictures from the Wannsee.  I just didn't take any pictures really when Drew was around.  And I don't have any pictures from my classes, obviously.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/114581487539334285/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=114581487539334285&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/114581487539334285'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/114581487539334285'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/04/sommersemester-woche-1-drew-visits-die.html' title='Sommersemester Woche 1, Drew Visits, &amp; Die Wannsee'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-114501591102870947</id><published>2006-04-14T13:12:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2006-04-14T13:58:31.046+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>A random assortment of thoughts</title><content type='html'>Not that I have much to write, but I'd like to say that I never know when holidays are. Because I never know when holidays are, I never know when stuff (ie: life sustaining establishments, a.k.a. supermarkets) is closed. For example, today. I thought, "Wow, it's a lovely day out! I'm going to bring back some of those beer bottles sitting in the kitchen." I stuck 30 bottles into a &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/1600/IMG_1818.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 287px; height: 216px;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/320/IMG_1818.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;backpack and 20 more in two separate canvas bags. I walked around the block and to my dismay and annoyance, the Getränkmarkt was closed. Already feeling like a dumb ass, I noticed that the supermarket next door was also shut. At that point, I just wanted to drop everything, fall to my knees, and scream, "Nooooo!" I forgot: It's Good Friday. Translation for me: Good Friday = everything closed in Germany. (And Easter = some holiday about some guy named Jesus returning.) Unlike in the U.S. where everything is open no matter what (with the exception of Christmas, which is the only religious holiday I can remember the date of), everything shuts down here. All I can say is I hope that everything is open tomorrow, otherwise I will be sustaining on plain pasta, bread, tomatoes, and what little cheese I have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and just to let you know...that's actually an older picture of the bottles that accumulated in our kitchen. (I took most of them back in a two day period) They really do accumulate. After about 5 or 6 bottles per person per week (on occasion more if we go out), times three people (well, not with the new roommate, but that picture was taken before Pablo moved out), plus times we have friends come over (add on another 3 bottles per visitor, I'd say)...it adds up. Even if we didn't have people over, that's about 15 to 18 bottles per week, and I take the bottles back maybe once every month. Just to let you know, there are more than 100 bottles in that picture. Yup...&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;100 bottles of beer on the floor, 100 bottles of beer&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/54/126325258_36a14a99e4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 285px; height: 214px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/54/126325258_36a14a99e4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Doug enjoying a Paulaner Hefeweißen Bier in Görlitzer Park...but out of a can!  *gasp*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, Doug and his friend Chris (and Chris' brother) were here last week in Berlin visiting. We met up for the day and I showed them parts of Berlin. &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/55/126325358_7518ded040.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 288px; height: 216px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/55/126325358_7518ded040.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(We took the scheiss Bus 100. How many times have I taken it?? It's not your fault, Doug.) It was such a lovely day out that we decided to sit out in Görlitzer Park near my apartment and drink some beer and soda. People were out and about because of the weather, walking around, sitting and playing music, enjoying a cup of something outside at a cafe, biking, running, etc. While we were in Görlitzer Park, you could see the colorful motley that makes up Berlin: punks (Punk is NOT dead by any means), hippies, hipsters, goths, students, Turks, fashionistas, fashion victims, old people, young people, gay people, straight people. Everybody doesn't give a damn what everybody else thinks of them and for this reason, I love Berlin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The summer here is supposed to be extraordinary and you can tell that it will be. In addition to the World Cup (WM, as the Germans call it, short for Weltmeisterschaft), it's going to be wonderful to see everybody out and about enjoying the weather. Even yesterday when the weather was more on the downside (gray, colder, a little rainy), people were fishing along the Spree, walking dogs, or still biking. I myself went for a walk in Treptower Park, even though it was probably a better idea to stay inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/1600/IMG_2265.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 278px; height: 208px;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/320/IMG_2265.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In addition to walking in Treptower Park, I made a small trip to Platz der Luftbrücke, where the Berlin Airlift took place. In addition to a memorial to the Luftbrücke, Berlin's biggest airport, Flughafen Tempelhof, is also there. For those of you, like me, that are huge fans of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&lt;/span&gt;, the airport where the zeppelin takes off and where Indy says, "No ticket!" is Tempelhof. Yes, I am a dork. I never would've thought of it, though, had Christian not said anything while we watched the movie. Of course, I had to take pictures. I'll actually go inside it when Tracie comes to visit me, since she's flying in there.  (The thing on the left is the memorial to the Airlift, and the building behind it is Tempelhof.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, classes (finally) begin on Tuesday. I have a list of about 15 or so to go to. I'm just hoping that my schedule works out advantageously like it did last semester so that I can travel on the weekends. My goal for this semester: München, Hamburg, Heidelberg, and Wien.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/114501591102870947/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=114501591102870947&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/114501591102870947'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/114501591102870947'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/04/random-assortment-of-thoughts.html' title='A random assortment of thoughts'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-114345495243897631</id><published>2006-03-27T11:33:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2006-03-27T14:33:25.296+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Spring break in Japan</title><content type='html'>I haven't posted in awhile for two main reasons: First, Alexandra was here in Berlin visiting. We had tons of fun imitating statues, imagining my new roommate as Batman, climbing the Siegesäule and getting lightheaded on the climb down, and eating lots of Kartoffelsuppe. If you want to see pictures (which I must say are pretty hysterical), go &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee/sets/72057594090824830/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/47/118348426_ef259c768d.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 179px; height: 239px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/47/118348426_ef259c768d.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The other main reason why I've been M.I.A.? This tiny little archipelago in Asia called "Japan." I was there visiting Dan for the week and we went to Tokyo and hung out in Kyoto. We made a pretty funny couple since everyone assumed that I knew Japanese, though the extent of my Japanese is "Arigato" (thanks). People would direct questions and comments to me, to which I would just stare at them blankly or just give a puzzled look, say, "Um, Dan...?" and Dan would answer in Japanese. I think we confused quite a few people. On the flight to Osaka Airport, the flight attendants assumed I was Japanese and passed me by when handing out landing cards, even though I raised my hand indicating I needed one. D'oh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/36/118358873_942938e9a6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 208px; height: 278px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/36/118358873_942938e9a6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The first day I was there, we went to see a light festival that was being held in Gion. I was surprisingly not dying of jetlag and we walked all over looking at temples and shrines. It was really beautiful despite the fact that it was lightly raining. On Sunday, we went to Fushimi Inari Shrine, which is this huge shrine with tons of torii (gates). If you've seen the movie &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Memoirs of a Geisha&lt;/span&gt;, it's the place where the little girl runs under all these orange things. There was a lot of climbing up stairs and hills, wandering on paths that took us through clusters of bamboo trees, and we got to see Kyoto from above. We wandered off a path a little too far and actually accidentally left the Fushimi Inari Shrine, so we had to climb back up a large hill and find the path again. It was a beautiful day and much walking/hiking/wandering was done. By the time we were done discovering the shrine, we were beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/48/118375974_77d41560f0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 260px; height: 195px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/48/118375974_77d41560f0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday evening after the Fushimi Inari Shrine, we took an overnight bus to Tokyo. The 8 hour ride itself sucked because neither Dan nor I could really sleep and the bus was ridiculously hot. When we got to Tokyo, it was too early to do anything, so we ate breakfast in Tokyo Station (we found a McDonald's). Once the city began to wake, we walked to the Imperial Palace, which wasn't actually that interesting. We saw the big wall surrounding the palace and everything was closed. It was a bit disappointing, but Dan said that the Imperial Palace in Kyoto was far more impressive. On Dave Ly's recommendation, we went to Odaiba, this district near the Rainbow Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/47/118378012_6ec12bcc1b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 232px; height: 174px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/47/118378012_6ec12bcc1b.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went to Decks Tokyo Beach, which is this weird cluster of malls. Why weird? Well, we found Little Hong Kong on the top two floors of one mall. It was strange and a bit cheesy, but we managed to find a good Chinese restaurant. (This made me pretty happy, considering I can't find Chinese food here in Berlin to my liking.) We then went down a few floors and crossed to a mall that was directly next to the first. It was even more bizarre than the first; it was as if someone transported us to 1950's Tokyo. All the stores sold nostalgic goods or just plain strange Japanese things. For example, we found this store that sold all this crazy stuff with cats dressed up like humans (samurai, ninjas, students, etc.) Check &lt;a href="http://www.nameneko.com/"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; out if you don't believe me.  Although it was a bit strange and foreign to us, we enjoyed walking around nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/48/118383173_0d84463fb3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 280px; height: 210px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/48/118383173_0d84463fb3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tuesday was Dan's 21st birthday, but instead of doing the usual let's-get-drunk-because-you're-legal thing, we went to Tokyo Disney instead. We chose to go to DisneySea instead of the main Disneyland park and we spent the whole day there. You would think that it wouldn't be so different than Disneyworld or Disneyland in the US, but oh, is it. Besides lots of crazy little Japanese girls running around, the stuff they sell is different, everything is in Japanese (even the characters talk in Japanese, obviously), and the atmosphere is very, well, Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rides there were pretty sweet. I was most psyched about the Indiana Jones ride, since I'd been on the one in Disneyland in California. It was pretty much the same, except Indy speaks in Japanese. (I definitely made a video of that.) Our other favorite ride was&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/39/118391976_fd1a99f46a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 270px; height: 201px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/39/118391976_fd1a99f46a.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Journey to the Center of the Earth, which seemed a little boring ("What is all this colorful stuff?"), then suddenly there's this big ass monster ("What the fuck is that?!" was my reaction), and finally, a big ass drop and you zoom along really fast. I convinced Dan to go on Raging Spirits, a roller coaster that had one loop, and he actually enjoyed it. We also went on a 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ride that made me claustrophobic and motion sick (it didn't help that the ride simulated being under water), a small roller coaster that was Little Mermaid themed, and some others that I can't recall. Of course, we also saw some shows. One was really weird and trippy (I fell asleep for a little) and the other was a live performance of Little Mermaid songs. The songs were in English, but when the characters spoke, it was in Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not going to detail the whole day in DisneySea, but it was a really good time. Dan and I were both amused that we were kids for a day instead of being legal and getting drunk. We just had a beer each when we got back to our hotel. Oh, and I would like to say that I bought the best hat ever from DisneySea, which is super Japanese. I look Japanese. Here's a picture of me in it imitating a Japanese tourist:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/1600/SannieTrip_99_37.0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 252px; height: 189px;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/320/SannieTrip_99_37.0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yeah. So the next day, we wandered around a cemetery and then went to Shibuya. Shibuya is the part of Tokyo with tons of bright lights and ads and &lt;span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"&gt;tons&lt;/span&gt; of people. People will collect &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/35/118411737_cb7b26c16b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 215px; height: 287px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/35/118411737_cb7b26c16b.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;waiting for the pedestrian lights to change, and when they do, there are just swarms of people crossing every which way. It's a bit intimidating and chaotic, but at the same time, it's what you think of when you think "Tokyo." We met up with Dave for dinner to have shabu-shabu, which is Japanese hot pot. There is a small pot of water and sauce that sits on a stovetop on your table and you continually add vegetables, tofu, and meat. It was sort of strange because Dan kept saying, "More meat!" I suppose it was strange because the entire trip, I would hear, "More meat!" or "Mmm...meat" or something along those lines from him. Newsflash: Dan eats meat now. It was probably the weirdest thing that happened in the week I was in Japan. More so than the crazy Japanese people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left Tokyo on another overnight bus ride back to Kyoto and Thursday, we slept at Dan's host family's. At night, we met up with Dan's friends Sam and Mason, Sam's visiting friend Clay, and Mason's Japanese girlfriend whose name I can't recall. We had dinner at a sushi place that had a conveyor belt with all the dishes just rotating around the room, and yes, I did try sushi. However, I still can't get over the texture of fish, and thus, I still don't like it. But I tried it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/49/118415795_414363a2d2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer; width: 234px; height: 175px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/49/118415795_414363a2d2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/55/118417404_3c9cceea6f.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer; width: 236px; height: 177px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/55/118417404_3c9cceea6f.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dinner, everyone but Mason's girlfriend went to do some karaoke. We got our own room, had some drinks, and did tons of songs from Weezer's "Buddy Holly" to Little Richard's "Tutti Frutti" to Madonna's "Like a Prayer" (Dan, Sam, and I were all about Midd Pride!) to Bon Jovi's "Livin' on a Prayer" (Jersey Pride!). It was lots of fun. I even did Nena's "99 Luftballons" in German by myself. I'll admit that it's too bad I don't do karaoke more often, even though I think I'm pretty awful at singing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last day in Japan was spent with Dan wandering around near the Imperial Palace in Kyoto. Tourists and ordinary folk aren't actually allowed within &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/54/118429553_440dfc70a8.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 239px; height: 179px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/54/118429553_440dfc70a8.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;the walls of the palace, so we walked outside it. The cherry blossoms ("sakura" in Japanese) were starting to bloom and were extraordinarily beautiful. Too bad the sakura festivals are a little later. Nonetheless, I took tons of pictures. Dan and I sat under the sakura enjoying our time together, watched some mothers struggling with their children, and relaxed in the amazing springtime weather. We also went by his university where the Japanese students were starting second semester and then returned to his host family's house to have dinner. Dan's host mom cooked a Japanese feast of tempura and other goodies. It was pretty delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/39/118389574_67101fb7f2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 171px; height: 221px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/39/118389574_67101fb7f2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On Saturday, Dan and I woke up at 5:30 a.m. so that I could catch a train to Osaka Kansai Airport. It was a good week all in all, we sorted things out, and we're still going strong. This trip was actually the first trip where I didn't think, "Thank God! I'm going back to Berlin!" When I got back here, all I could think was, "Hmm, I miss Dan, I miss the food!" I have nothing to do for the next two weeks before classes start up again except watching movies, planning my next semesters (this coming and fall back at Midd), and basically, just bumming around. Even so, I'm looking forward to relaxing and time alone since the past month has been filled with visitors and visiting. It's time to recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;If you want to see more pictures from my trip to Japan, &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee/sets/72057594091378330/"&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt;.

Ethel, my friend/supervisor from my internship at Fuse, arrived in Berlin last Friday, and on Saturday we flew to Düsseldorf for Karneval. Why Düsseldorf, of all cities, you ask? Christian had invited me (or us) to celebrate Karneval there with him and his friends since it's his hometown. I figured it would be a great experience, especially with a local. He and Pablo repeatedly told me that I had no idea what to expect and they were completely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/40/108127001_5c21267dfd.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/40/108127001_5c21267dfd.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After walking around the city, Ethel and I met up with Christian and his friends and went to their local pub, Schaukel Stühlchen. Everyone, from old couples to teenagers, was on the street dancing outside the pub to music blasting from speakers when we went in. We spent most of the night there, where Ethel and I (and everyone else) drank a lot of the local Schlösser Alt bier, although I had been warned to not drink it. (My verdict: Not bad.) The music was a mix between traditional German Karneval songs (which Christian and his friends all knew and sang along to), 80s pop songs, current dance hits, and indie rock. After a considerable time at Schaukel Stühlchen, Christian, his friend Sven, Ethel, and I went dancing at a club called Stone, where the music was mostly indie rock and German pop. We danced through the night until we got kicked out at about 4:30/5 a.m. and Ethel and I took a cab back to our hostel and tried not to wake up the other people in the room. It was a bit difficult for me because I was on the top bunk, and after having a lot to drink, let's just say it wasn't an easy task climbing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday we woke up at 9 a.m. and working on four hours of sleep, Ethel and I took a local train to Köln to see the Karneval festivities there. I would just like to say that the cathedral &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/34/108126933_615c198350.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/34/108126933_615c198350.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Kölner Dom) is probably the most impressive cathedral I've ever seen. Besides that, the festivities were quite obvious with costumed people lining up on the street to watch the parade. The parade basically was all the schoolkids dressed up marching around and it felt like it lasted forever. Ethel and I got tired of watching and were cold, so wandered the city in search of anything but the parade. That mission seemed to have failed, mostly because everything was closed. We did, however, sit in a Burger King drinking tea (since it was about the only place open) observing some teenagers drunk to the point of passing out. This was about 4 in the afternoon. Because we had partied late into the night before, we couldn't bring ourselves to drink the local beer, Kölsch, nor really party. We went back to Düsseldorf and went to sleep relatively early in order to be ready for Rosenmontag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/39/108130557_13267fd98e.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/39/108130557_13267fd98e.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosenmontag is apparently the biggest day of Karneval and we spent it in Düsseldorf. We met up with Christian and his friends again to watch (yet another) parade. However, this parade was much better than the one we had seen in Köln because it was just float after float. Much like Jackie and Doug observed with their Karneval experiences, it seemed to be a day of not being politically correct. Then again, people were dressed up as Mexicans and Indians that would've given Middlebury College a heart attack. There was even one float of "Africans," a.k.a. Germans dressed up as Africans and wearing blackface. I was slightly shocked, but got over it relatively quickly. (There is, afterall, no real word for "PC" in German, except for "PC.")&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching the parade was an experience in itself. Everyone was drinking beer, whether they had &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/36/108133269_e2e63cbb50.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/36/108133269_e2e63cbb50.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bought it from a stand or had brought it in a wagon, bag, etc. The floats that went by ranged from political humor (making fun of Dubyah or Angie), to local humor (which Ethel and I didn't get), to just plain fun. There were also several marching bands that made me really excited. By the end of the parade, everyone was ready to hit up the bars, and so, we did. We went back to Schaukel Stühlchen and continued to drink and party from about 4 pm to 9 pm or so. It was pretty much like Saturday night except for the fact that more beer was consumed at an earlier hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left the bar to go to a club where there were not that many people there. It actually didn't matter at that point because everyone was pretty much drunk and having a good time regardless. At one point, a whole drum line came into the club and played some traditional German Karneval songs. It was a very good night and was especially great because we got to do as the locals did. My conclusion is that Germans really know how to party and we need to bring Karneval to the U.S. However, it would probably never work, just because there's such a stigma against drinking and we are always concerned about being PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Wednesday, Ethel and I flew from Köln/Bonn airport to Prague. I'm not going to spend much time detailing what went down in Prague, because frankly, not much happened. We actually wanted to try to change our train tickets to come back a day earlier, but unfortunately, it wasn't possible. Prague is a beautiful city, unlike many German cities, since it was basically untouched during the World Wars. It is definitely beautiful in the sense of being a romantic European city and it made me miss having someone with me to just walk through the streets admiring it.&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/36/108110329_7dcdadf227.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 252px; height: 336px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/36/108110329_7dcdadf227.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/40/108110534_7c98135c7b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 201px; height: 267px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/40/108110534_7c98135c7b.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The people we met at the hostel all said the same exact thing: Once you see one thing in Prague, you've basically seen everything. In my opinion, this is true. A good metaphor: Prague is the beautiful woman with no personality. Berlin is the average-looking woman with tons of personality. We explored Prague Castle, saw the Franz Kafka and Toy Museums, and an Alfons Mucha gallery. (Not the museum) To make a long story short, I appreciate Berlin even more now and I'm glad to be back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethel left this morning and I have five days to myself before Alexandra comes to visit me here in Berlin. We'll probably stay here in Berlin and then a week after she arrives, I leave for Japan (when she goes home). More adventures to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;You can see pictures from Karneval &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee/sets/72057594075406381/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I warn you, there are many drunken photos.&lt;br /&gt;You can see pictures from Prague &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee/sets/72057594075380159/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/114158116633409302/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=114158116633409302&amp;isPopup=true' title='7 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/114158116633409302'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/114158116633409302'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/03/karneval-prague.html' title='Karneval &amp; Prague'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-114053780751633059</id><published>2006-02-21T14:34:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2006-02-21T17:03:28.050+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>2006 Winter Olympics: Torino, Italy</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/31/102309310_9969e1337f.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 230px; height: 307px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/31/102309310_9969e1337f.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This weekend actually started off here in Berlin when I told Pablo that I'd go with him and his friends clubbing on Friday. Apparently it was the best drum &amp; bass party of the year at this club called Watergate, which overlooks the Oberbaum Brücke, and the entry fee was 10€. (Expensive by Berlin standards.) I'd said that I would only stay until 2, the latest at 2:30, because I had to wake up early to get to the airport. Well, go figure, I stayed longer and actually enjoyed the drum &amp;amp; bass floor more than the "mainstream" floor. To my complete surprise, I was pretty much dancing (or rather, bouncing) the entire time, whether because I wanted to, or to avoid some people (whose names will not be mentioned, but Alex, you know who I mean if you're reading this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left Watergate at around 4 a.m, walked home, got in the shower (couldn't go to sleep all gross!), and went to bed by 4:30-5 a.m. I woke up at 8:45 a.m. in order to eat breakfast, make sure I had all my things packed, and got to the airport. I had a layover at Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris and the weather was pretty crappy, but all went smoothly and I got to Torino on time where I met up with Hugo and his friend Elizabeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as we got into the city, we rushed off to pick up&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/36/102305191_0b094bf017.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 244px; height: 183px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/36/102305191_0b094bf017.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; our tickets and then rushed off again so that Hugo and I could get to our hockey game on time. When we got to the arena, the game was only 4 minutes into the first period and it was already loud, packed, and full of energy. Hugo and I kept exclaiming to each other that it was unbelievable that we were actually there in Torino at the hockey game. We had been planning the hockey game for over a year already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game was pretty awesome, mostly due to the energy from the fans. There were lots of, "Settle down, boys!," "Stop being so sloppy!," and "What the fuck?!" from the Americans. (I didn't understand the Slovakian fans) From me, I kept shouting in German: "Nein!!!," "Was macht ihr?!," and "Verdammt Scheiss!" (I concluded that it was much more expressive, and well, it just came out in German, except for the times that I was shouting, "Yeaaah!!") I have to admit, both teams seemed to be a bit sloppy, but especially the Americans. There were times when it seemed that players forgot they had the puck, just didn't look up to see a pass coming, or just passed it way out yonder or to the Slovakians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad there isn't a website "overheardattheolympics.com."  (If you don't know what I'm &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/30/102306293_9c602781f0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/30/102306293_9c602781f0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;referring to, check &lt;a href="http://www.overheardinnewyork.com/"&gt;this website out&lt;/a&gt; now. It's hilarious.) At the hockey game, some of the best quotes included a guy on his cell phone ("Dude! Are you watching TV now? The US vs. Slovakia game? Yeah! I'm there, man! I'm &lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt; the Olympics! I'm behind the American bench! Well, no, farther up. But I'm there, man!") and another guy behind us ("Um, I'm already drunk. It's only the first period, isn't it?"). I'm sure some of the stuff that Hugo and I said were pretty ridiculous. We tried doing some Middlebury cheers (Tiny Bubbles and the one when we win), but we couldn't remember all of Tiny Bubbles. (Beer = cheer, Gin = win, that's all we remembered).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;After the hockey game, we went to meet up with Devin, except that it didn't really happen. Hugo got us really lost and we wound up near the Olympic Village for the athletes, when Devin was by the Sponsors Village. Two hours later than we had said, we finally met at the train station Porta Nuova. We were supposed to meet up with Hugo's other friends who were in 2 other groups, but that just didn't happen. Time went by rather quickly, and by the time we knew it, it was too late to get the last trains and too early to get the first trains out to Sangano, where we were staying with a family. I was exhausted and admittedly cranky since I was running on 4 hours or less of sleep. Hugo, Devin, and I decided to just sit and hang out in the train station for a little bit, then we met up with one group of his other friends. We finally got a train at around 5 a.m., got back to where we were staying and went to sleep at 7 a.m. (Yup, a 23 hour day for me.)&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/43/102306367_d592ccf260.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/43/102306367_d592ccf260.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Porta Nuova, the train station, with the Olympic Rings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devin and Hugo had said they were going to wake up early, but I knew it wasn't going to happen. We ended up getting up at 1 p.m. and getting into Torino by around 2:30/3 pm, where we tried figuring out train tickets out to Sauze d'Oulx, where the freestyle skiing was taking place. (It's rather close to the French border.) That took up more time than we expected, so instead of wandering the city as we had planned, we grabbed some food quickly and got on the train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/31/102307242_842e037b46.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 281px; height: 211px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/31/102307242_842e037b46.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The ride out to Sauze d'Oulx was about 45 minutes, and then an additional 30 minutes by bus up the mountain. When we got there, it was snowing pretty hard, and when neared the actual venue, we were told that the event was postponed until 8:30 pm. We found a small bar that was relatively empty and drank some hot drinks, but then heard that the event was postponed even more. Finally, we actually got word that due to the heavy snowfall, the event was to be rescheduled for Tuesday, 21 February. It was disappointing, since Devin and I were flying back here to Berlin on Monday, and Hugo and Elizabeth had to go back to Ferrara for classes. Elizabeth and I trekked back down to the venue to see if anything could be done about a refund, where we got the last forms in English to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone had to leave the mountain since almost no one was staying there. It was rather chaotic trying to stay together and not get seperated, but we managed. (Devin's quote: "I think we just got seperated from our peeps.") The buses were boarded and people were in lines for the next buses to come, but nothing was moving. No traffic was coming or going. Word got around that the climb down the mountain was only 30 minutes. Devin, Hugo, Elizabeth, and I decided that we might as well walk, since the traffic wasn't moving and it didn't seem that we were going to get a bus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the walk down was way longer than 30 minutes. It took us 2&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/42/102307796_78503b7d25.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 255px; height: 191px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/42/102307796_78503b7d25.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hours to get walk to the train station. What we didn't realize was the mountain was 1,509 meters high (or 4,950 feet). Additionally, it took a little longer than expected because there was snow and nobody wanted to fall. The whole experience felt like a disaster movie with loads of people walking by stuck cars, or it felt like a zombie movie because there were points where there just lots of people walking in the dark. Then suddenly there would be one shining light, and everyone was just surprised to see there was light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/19/102308378_bb9715ce0e.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 168px; height: 225px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/19/102308378_bb9715ce0e.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It was pretty beautiful walking down. The mountains eerily rose out of the darkness and were these huge gray masses with very little light. Looking up from where we had walked from, there were bright lights illuminating the whisps of cloud and outlining the crowds of people walking down. Additionally, we walked through one or two very small mountain towns that were very rustic and Italian. I have several pictures up on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee"&gt;Flickr account&lt;/a&gt; and you can view all my pictures from Torino as a &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee/sets/72057594067653652/"&gt;slideshow&lt;/a&gt;, if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, Sunday was spent trying to get an event that didn't even happen, but it still made for a fun experience. On Monday, we actually woke up early (7 a.m.) and got into Torino by 9:30 so that&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/28/102310331_bd0fffbfb3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 206px; height: 153px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/28/102310331_bd0fffbfb3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we could explore. We first went to go see the Shroud of Turin at the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. We had kept making jokes all weekend that this was the one damn thing in Turin that we had to see, and it had better not be a disappointment, like a giant piece of toilet paper or something. We only could see a replica of it with pictures of it x-rayed underneath, and then way up front, the Shroud was in a case of aluminum and glass lying horizontally. &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/34/102310061_54bac84207.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 210px; height: 157px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/34/102310061_54bac84207.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I could see how it sort of looked like Jesus, but as an atheist, I wasn't that convinced, though it was pretty remarkable to see. (I personally thought it looked like a big tablecloth with a big coffee stain on it that happened to look like Jesus. Not that I'm saying it's real or not. That's just my perception of what it looked like to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Shroud, we went to go see La Mole Antonelliana, which was a synagogue at one point and is currently the highest point in Turin. Unfortunately, the elevator to the panaromic view was closed because it was Monday. La Mole is basically that thing that you see in all the Visa ads with a ski jumper going past it. Devin and Hugo kept saying that it looked like a large stump coming out of a dome. I suppose that's one way you could describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/25/102310508_664fc2e575.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 229px; height: 304px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/25/102310508_664fc2e575.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;La Mole Antonelliana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, we went and got some food near the Sponsors Village, where this huge plastic thing that Devin described as an Aggro Crag. (Yes, that thing from that show&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/41/102311134_2ffdc05771.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 239px; height: 180px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/41/102311134_2ffdc05771.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Guts&lt;/span&gt; on Nickelodeon.) I forgot to take a picture of it. After lunch, Devin had to leave to catch a train to Milan, where her flight back was leaving from. Hugo, Elizabeth, and I went into the Sponsors Village to see if we could buy anything, but it turned out that the huge Olympic store was in some plaza a bit farther out than I could go, since I had to catch a bus to the airport for my flight. However, we did see past Olympic torches on display there. The three of us departed at the Sponsors Village and I walked back to a smaller Olympic store closer to the Medals Plaza. I came to the conclusion that there wasn't anything worth buying, so I didn't spend any money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually awake for part of from Torino to Paris. The view from the plane was stunning and I had to take some pictures of the Alps. After that, I actually fell asleep so deeply after not getting much sleep in Torino that the only thing that woke me was when the plane landed. I had to admit that I was relieved to get back to Berlin, if only because the public transportation here is so much more reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/29/102311234_e9c86d7850.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 255px; height: 191px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/29/102311234_e9c86d7850.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;The view of the Alps from the plane from Torino to Paris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the week will be devoted to resting up from the Olympics and getting ready for Karneval in Düsseldorf and Köln.

However, I am finished with all of my papers and classes, so I can finally say, "The semester has officially come to an end." Technically it ends tomorrow when I email all my papers in, but whatever. I haven't been doing anything for the past two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, there is one thing that has been going on since 9 February, which is the Berlin Film &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/32/100545545_edf736efd4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 185px; height: 248px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/32/100545545_edf736efd4.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Festival (aka "Die Berlinale"). Christian, Pablo, and I wanted to go see &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;V for Vendetta &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Syriana&lt;/span&gt;, but both sold out before we got tickets.  I wound up seeing &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Roman Holiday&lt;/span&gt; on my own and it was pretty lucky that I even got a ticket. I had gone to the ticket booth over in the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden expecting that it wouldn't be sold out, but I was wrong. I decided to go to the venue (which was literally across the street) and see if I could somehow get a ticket there. I was standing on the line when a guy approached me and asked, "Willst du eine Karte für &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Roman Holiday&lt;/span&gt;?" to which I answered, "Ja, gern! Danke schön!" I bought it off him for the same price he bought it for (7€) and got the chance to see the movie on a real movie screen. Additionally, there was a guy from Paramount Pictures who had helped do the digital restoration of the print that was being shown and he introduced the film. That was really fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weekend I'm flying to Turin for the Olympics. I'm looking forward to it, but at the same time, I'm a bit nervous. I don't know why, but I'm just crazy like that. It's kind of sad because I haven't really been able to watch the Olympics. Ok, I'll admit the reason why is because I can never find them on TV. (Call me stupid.) Plus, I never watch TV, so I never know when they're on. If you're watching the Olympics this weekend and watch a hockey game (USA vs. Slovakia) or women's quarterfinals for aerials, I'll be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Andere Ereignisse" that have been going on: Christian and I found a new roommate to take Pablo's room when Pablo moves out. It turns out that Pablo isn't moving back home to Köln, rather, he's moving in with Julian (his friend) and staying here in Berlin. It makes me a little sad because Pablo and I have had some good times recently, having a good laugh. He asked if I could make pancakes (last night I made brownies from scratch) because apparently he likes pancakes, so I did. But yeah, he moves out on February 28, when I'm in Düsseldorf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new roommate that Christian and I "chose" is named Valentin. The reason why I put chose in quotes is because we chose him by default. Three people came to see the apartment, the two that we liked better took other apartments, and that left Valentin. When he came to see the apartment, Christian and I agreed that he seemed to have no personality. But whatever, it's for two months when Heike comes back and then I'll move into Pablo's room (which is actually Krischan's). I still haven't decided if I'm going to stay through August or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing that happened is that last Friday Alex and Meredith left to start spring semester at Middlebury. I helped Alex pack up her life into some bags and shit, it was a lot. &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/35/98460949_9f393a03f6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 218px; height: 163px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/35/98460949_9f393a03f6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'm posting a picture of Meredith and Alex's stuff combined at Tegel. It's been really bizarre this past week without being able to constantly call Alex and say stupid stuff, such as, "You need to see this mullet on the U-bahn right now," or, "Oh God, I just ran into (insert name here) and it sucked." Additionally, I've been over by Meredith's U-bahn stop and it's strange to think, "Wow, I don't know anyone that lives here anymore."  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that when Alex and I were taking a cab to the hotel that we all stayed in near the airport, I thought to myself how I am so incredibly glad that I am staying here for the year.  I was filled with various emotions, from jealousy (dining halls, classes in English, familiarity) to sadness (no more rolling over and making calls on the weekends to hear that I'm not the only one wallowing in bed) to content/relief (that I'm staying the year). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I think it's just readjusting to the fact that I have fewer friends here and have to wait until the other MiddKids get here.  Then again, I'll be traveling for the next five weeks (which means I will be updating my blog less frequently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and another event (but completely mundane) is that I cut my own hair.  It turned out really well, even though it was my first time cutting it myself.  Just thought I'd like to tell everyone that.  Go me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Currently listening to "Tremenda Expectativa" by Dan Den.

I had given a presentation for my comics course and used my computer for a Power Point presentation. It started to freak out in the middle of the presentation (to which I muttered, "Fuck!" Not good.) and then it just stopped working. The screen would remain black while the rest of the computer whirred normally. I had to take it to the Apple Center here and damn, they suck in comparison to the service in the U.S. Just a tip, kids: If you want stuff done here in Germany, it'll take a long time. "Service is a desert" (Dienst ist eine Wüste) is one of the sayings they have here that Christian told me. I concur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, that's the first part of the update. To explain the "deep frozen hot dogs" part really quickly: Pablo bought these deep frozen hot dogs from Plus two weeks ago. They're disgusting. &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/25/94152076_8c34e0085a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 233px; height: 175px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/25/94152076_8c34e0085a.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's a frozen hot dog on a frozen bun with ketchup, cheese, bacon, pickles, and possibly some sauerkraut frozen on top of it. I was in disbelief that he would actually eat it and his reasoning was, "But I want to try it at least once!" (They came in packs of two.) I know the picture is blurry, but I had to take it without a flash, otherwise you wouldn't be able to see the glory of the disgusting frozen hot dog. I also told Pablo, "Man, Americans put a lot of junk into their bodies, but you wouldn't be able to pay me to eat that!" To top it off, he threw it into the microwave to heat it up. Microwaved stuff is always mushier than if you put it into the oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of mushy...My embarassing moment of the week. I had made a tiramisu this past weekend using a recipe from my sister and it turned out really well. We ate it only after it sat in the refrigerator for an hour or two and put the rest back into the fridge. The next day, there was enough that Christian and I were just like, "Well, we'll just eat the rest out of the pan." (Actually, there was a lot, which I, the fat ass that I am, mostly ate.) I pulled the pan out of the fridge and said to him, "Hey, the tiramisu is firmer as yesterday. It's not as mushy." He looked at me and said, "What did you say?" I replied in German, "Die Tiramisu ist stärker heute. Es ist nicht so....um, mushy. Wie sagt man 'mushy' auf deutsch?" He started snickering at me and said, "Weisst du, was 'mushy' auf deutsch bedeutet?" I probably looked utterly confused because he started cracking up. I repeated myself, "The tiramisu isn't so mushy today!" He laughed even more and through his laughing, managed out the reason why it was so funny: "Mushy in German is slang for a woman's vagina!" I was so embarrassed, but hey, how am I supposed to know that? So to make things better, I just repeated myself. "The tiramisu isn't mushy....auf deutsch oder auf englisch!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/19/94146656_d2114ee24a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 210px; height: 280px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/19/94146656_d2114ee24a.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Statue of Goethe and Schiller in front of the theater in Weimar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last order of business to tell about is our little trip to Weimar two and a half weeks ago. It was the trip to hell. Seriously. Weimar is a cute little city as you can see by the many, many photos I took there. However, there is &lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;nothing&lt;/span&gt; to do after 4 pm when the museums close.  There is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt; nightlife whatsoever, probably because Weimar is filled with little old German people. And even with the museums open during the day, they're tiny. Devin and I went to the Bauhaus and Schloss Museums and we managed to go through both of them in their entireties (is that a word?) in about 4 hours total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/14/94150959_2412593149.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 173px; height: 231px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/14/94150959_2412593149.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I have to say, though, that the highlight of the trip was Friday night dinner in a restaurant with almost the entire program there, including those from Mainz (meaning, one student and Oliver Strauss, our TA from freshmen year). We sat at these round tables that were brought together and it was a bit strange because down at one end of the table, Kevin, Zoey, Meredith, Alex, and I were having a very nice conversation. In the middle, Oliver, Franziska, and Devin were having a nice chat. Then at the other end, it was just awkwardly silent. Dessert came around, and while reaching for her dessert from the waitress, the Mainz student knocked over Bill's tall half liter glass of beer which shattered and spilled beer onto Heike, the program director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other highlight of the excursion worth mentioning was that we went to &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/25/94151589_0216d48aec.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 255px; height: 191px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/25/94151589_0216d48aec.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Buchenwald, which was a concentration camp only 8 kilometers from Weimar. It was ridiculously miserable weather: cold, gray, cloudy, snow, and wind. We walked around while Heike told us some information, but pretty much everyone was miserable because of the weather (and the fact that it's not exactly a happy place to be). Devin, Zoey, Meredith, Alex, and I ran off as soon as we could so we could get back to Weimar and sit in a warm cafe. We felt a little guilty for leaving earlier than everyone else, but we were not pleased at all to be standing around in the cold. I think Meredith was the only one who had two pairs of pants on, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/43/94151699_0dbb82a154.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/43/94151699_0dbb82a154.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Alex, Meredith, Zoey, Devin, and me looking miserable after spending too much time outside at Buchenwald.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now it is nearing the end of the (first) semester and I am definitely looking forward to it. I've finished writing one paper, which I actually wrote by hand because I didn't have my computer. I have to see one more film for film history and write my paper for my French Revolution course. (And frankly this paper is going to kill me. It just doesn't want to be written.) At the end of it all, I will be going to Turin, Italy for the 2006 Olympics (what what!) for a weekend, and then Ethel is coming. We're going to Düsseldorf and Köln (Cologne) for 3 days for Karneval, and then we're heading off to Prague. It'll be a busy month. Oh, and then Alex and Meredith are leaving next week. Time flies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a ton of pics up on &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; from Weimar if you want to see more of them.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/113890084455312207/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=113890084455312207&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113890084455312207'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113890084455312207'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/02/computer-problems-deep-frozen-hot-dogs.html' title='Computer Problems, Deep Frozen Hot Dogs, Mushy Stuff, &amp; Weimar'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-113649341298066724</id><published>2006-01-05T21:27:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2006-01-07T00:06:25.113+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Frohes Neues Jahr!</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/38/80467185_55a1cec196.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 270px; height: 202px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/38/80467185_55a1cec196.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First off, Happy New Year to everyone, even though this is a little late in the well wishing. It's still a new year and will be for another 359 days and hopefully, 2006 will be a better year than 2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lannie and Chris arrived in Berlin on Silvester (December 31), but there wasn't much to do since it was a holiday. They came by my apartment later in the evening, as did Marisa, Liso, and of course Alex. Brad, a grad student in my program, also came because I had invited him. Anyway, we all managed to get one game of beer pong in and it was really great because I got Lannie to play. But whenever Liso or Alex got a ball into our cups, Lannie took a shot of tequila instead of drinking the beer because she doesn't like beer. Hardcore. I'll be getting those pictures from her that Chris took later and I must say, although we lost, it was pretty funny playing beer pong with Lannie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't the only person who had people over; Pablo had 3 friends staying over for a few days and then for the party, there were countless others. They stayed in the living room while we were in my room (Americans vs. Germans, I guess?), but then at around 11:20 pm we all left the apartment to go to the Oberbaum Brücke for fireworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have to say is that it was frickin CRAZY. First off, people were setting fireworks off in the middle of the street because they're legal here. You could just buy them in the local supermarket and set them off anywhere. Walking over, I felt like I was going to get my head blown off by someone. Pablo had suggested that we go on the bank of the river rather than &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/42/80465898_a27350cd4e.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/42/80465898_a27350cd4e.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;going on the actual bridge because the view would be better and he was completely right. There were fewer people, less smoke from fireworks, and way more room to scream "Happy New Year!" to each other. It was pretty incredible and I have to say, it was probably by far the best New Year's I've ever had. Sure, I've been in Times Square to ring in the new year with Dan, but that sort of sucked because we had to wait out in the cold for God knows how long without any sort of reassurance that we could go pee and find each other again. This was just awesome how you could just go out 40 minutes before the new year and get a great spot. Lannie and Chris went back to their hotel since their flight had arrived really early that day and wanted to get some rest, but everyone else stayed for a little while longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much sekt (champagne not from Champagne, France) was drank on my part because I had bought two cheap bottles for everyone. Unfortunately nobody was drinking them, so I drank practically an entire bottle to myself and Brad drank the other. Alex, Liso, Marisa, and I returned to my apartment with Brad and two German guys (a friend of Pablo, Julian, and a friend of his, Mathias). We didn't do too much, though I did make a few drunken calls to wish Dan, Jenny, and Ken happy new years. Liso, Marisa, and Brad left soon afterward and Julian and Mathias convinced Alex and me to go clubbing over in Görlitzer Park, which is about 2 blocks away from me. I didn't want to go, but Alex convinced me to go and paid for my entry fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/39/80466385_f3dc0332f0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 279px; height: 210px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/39/80466385_f3dc0332f0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To make a long story short, I came back to my apartment at 7 in the morning really drunk, so that when I woke up, I was still slightly drunk and then had my first hangover ever. Weirdest part of the night was when a girl in the club was dancing behind me and pawing on my Fair Lawn PD sweatshirt that Chris had given to me for Christmas. She was looking at the tag for some reason, whether it was because she lost her own jacket and was looking for it or because she thought it was a cool-looking sweatshirt, I'm not entirely sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, it was a very good start to the New Year. The rest of the week I was busy showing Lannie and Chris around Berlin. I think I gave them a pretty good variety of stuff to see and they went on their Trabi Safari, which I thought was pretty funny and cheesy. I hope &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/37/82700611_7bc60cdcd1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 263px; height: 197px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/37/82700611_7bc60cdcd1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;they had fun, even though poor Chris was sick most of the time. It was really great to see someone from home and the next person who will be coming from home is Jackie, though I won't see her for long, and then Ethel. Then the entire month will just be busy with her and then Alexandra (from Fair Lawn) coming, and then I'm off to Japan and then maybe my parents will come. (Wow, that was a horrible sentence I just wrote, but I'm sick with a cold and it's killing me.) I figured it out: During the month of March, I will have 6 days completely to myself. Time seriously flies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Currently listening to OK Go's album &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Oh No&lt;/span&gt; with "A Million Ways" playing.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/113649341298066724/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=113649341298066724&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113649341298066724'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113649341298066724'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/01/frohes-neues-jahr.html' title='Frohes Neues Jahr!'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-113543884492319561</id><published>2005-12-24T16:16:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2005-12-24T16:40:44.943+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Weihnachten ist am 24. Dezember...Wait, what?</title><content type='html'>As I write this entry, I am sitting ganz allein in my apartment. Pablo went home to Köln and Christian went home to Düsseldorf, so I have the apartment to myself. It's actually not too bad, but I really don't go into the living room or their rooms. I cleaned the other day so the whole apartment is spic and span clean. Hurrah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered that Germans celebrate Christmas (Weihnachten) on December 24th. Weird, right? I found out from Pablo one night when we were watching TV together and there was an ad that said something about the "1. Weihnachtstag." I asked what that was, he answered that it was the day after Weihnachten which is the 25th. I was like, "What are you talking about? No, Christmas is the 25th! You're shitting me!" I had to check a calendar to make sure, and sure enough, Arsenal (the cinema where I have to see films for film history) is closed today, the 24th, but not the 25th. Talk about getting culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liso and Marisa came from Prague and will be here in Berlin for the next few days, along with &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/9/76874045_de50ef8959.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/9/76874045_de50ef8959.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alex's family. It's been interesting so far because Alex has been grading Marisa on her performance in front of her parents. This means that Marisa is not allowed to swear (any words, such as "sucks," "crap," and anything worse than that), talk about sex in any form (including nudity), talk about drinking or drugs, and basically, just not saying anything that could offend Alex's parents. Last night Marisa got a B, mostly because she started going off on how some woman had "propositioned her" and then the first time she had tequila. I'm only wondering what is going down right now, since Liso and Marisa went touring with Alex and her family. I didn't go because I'll have to do the same things next week when Lannie comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't feel like Christmas at all.  So, I'd just like to share some random thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;1. Christian just called to wish me a Frohe Weihnachten, and I felt really stupid on the phone. I still hate talking on the phone in German because it's still really difficult. I also felt even more stupid because I didn't notice the little tree in the corner of his room that he wants me to water. I was like, "Wait, you have a little &lt;span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"&gt;tree &lt;/span&gt;in your room?"  Sometimes I think he must think I'm the stupidest person he's ever come across.  Oh well, such is life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It's amazing how the Stella McCartney H&amp;M stuff hasn't sold out here because I read some articles and heard from my sisters how bad it was in New York. Let's just put it this way: I found a crapload of stuff for 30-70% off, which is unbelievable that it's still there. I bought the wide leg pants and the jean jacket. Couldn't resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/36/76873478_a5a0cedad2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/36/76873478_a5a0cedad2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Dinner with the Romeros last night&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I called all my friends last night because they were at Matt's house. I'm sad that I'm not at home in New Jersey to spend the holidays with all of them since we always get together during the holidays. But it also felt good because they haven't forgotten me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I've come to the conclusion that I really, really love it here in Berlin. There is no other city in the world like it. I'd seriously consider moving back here after college to work if I could find a job. Sure, I get anti-Americanism once in awhile, but it doesn't come across a shock (though it always still sucks when it happens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I have discovered listening to Radio Eins here.  It's awesome and I must thank Nils for recommending it.  They play everything from Franz Ferdinand to The Beatles and then have news, as well as callers.  Since I have nobody to speak in German to, it's been helping me out with listening comprehension so that I don't become completely retarded (as in my first observation) with German.  And I'm listening to Radio Eins right now as there is a reading of some Christmas story.  Excellent.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/113543884492319561/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=113543884492319561&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113543884492319561'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113543884492319561'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/12/weihnachten-ist-am-24-dezemberwait.html' title='Weihnachten ist am 24.

I found it interesting that the building he works in is outfitted with solar panels on top, so that the electricity produced can be sold. I asked him how was it possible to get a lot of electricity if it's always cloudy in Berlin, but apparently it just works. Although Nils is not from Berlin, he's like my personal tour guide and knows a lot of handy little facts about the city, as well as history. It sort of makes me think, Wow, I wouldn't be able to pull out handy dandy little factoids if I showed someone around New York or Washington, D.C. But anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait too long to get into the Reichstag. It was a five minute wait, so I suppose being 2 hours late might've paid off, in the fact that we didn't have to wait in a long ass line. Nils said people can wait about 2 hours just to get in, but we were lucky. All we had to do was walk up to the entrance and go through a security check (which both of us set the metal detector off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inside of the Reichstag dome is really cool and very practical (typical German engineering). There are mirrors that catch the sunlight so &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/39/74079105_e87be0739e.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 305px; height: 229px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/39/74079105_e87be0739e.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;natural lighting can be used down below while discussions go on and of course, everything is controlled by computers. However, there is a large rotating shade that moves as the sunlight moves, so that the sunlight isn't too strong on the mirrors. Practical, environmentally friendly, and efficient. What you would think of Germans, right? In my opinion, the inside of the dome reminds me of the Death Star in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/span&gt;, when Lando Calrissian flies the Millenium Falcon to the center to destroy the reactor. (And yes, this is dorky, but seriously, just look at the picture!) People who like &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/span&gt; will probably agree with me.  (Speaking of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/span&gt; and going on another digression, Nils said that Germans don't say "Herr Vader," meaning "Mr. Vader," rather, they just say "Lord Vader" just like in English.) I tried finding a picture of the Death Star to put it up here, but I can't find one at the moment. You'll just have to go watch the movie or trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To explain my title for this post, the funny thing is that as soon as we got to the top of the Reichstag, I sniffed and all I could say was, "Es riecht wie....döner!" (It smells like döner!) Go figure. Berlin smells like döner, I swear. Not that it's a negative thing or anything, I just found it amusing that even the top of their government building smells like it. Ironically, it's a Turkish import.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/34/74079078_4aaef16bfd.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/34/74079078_4aaef16bfd.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Yet another tangent: Right now I've got an Ohrwurm, Nerf Herder's "Nikki Webster." I don't know why. And Ohrwurm is such a great word. It literally means "ear worm," but it means a song that you've got stuck in your head. I'll probably use that when I get home because saying "I've got a song stuck in my head!" takes more effort than "I've got an Ohrwurm!"&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/113473201063015733/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=113473201063015733&amp;isPopup=true' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113473201063015733'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113473201063015733'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/12/top-of-reichstag-smells-likedner.html' title='The Top of the Reichstag Smells Like...Döner.'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-113431606125431838</id><published>2005-12-11T16:02:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2005-12-11T16:47:41.280+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Final Draw - WM 2006/Wetten, Dass...</title><content type='html'>So Friday was the final draw for the Weltmeisterschaft 2006 (World Cup), where basically they chose which teams would play against whom.  I had gone out to eat with Alex, Zoey, and Meredith, and came back to my apartment to find Christian, Pablo, and some of Christian's friends ("Matze," Sebastian, &amp; his girlfriend) sitting in the living room around the TV.  Of course, this was not nearly an important event to me as it was to them, especially since I know nothing of which teams are good and which are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to sit down and watch, and all I can say is it was a pretty European moment.  Every so often, someone would either receive or make a phone call on his cell phone to say, "Kannst du es glauben?!" or something (Can you believe it).  Basically, the whole program was a bunch of guys standing in a crescent, picking balls out of these large bowls with team names and games on pieces of paper within the balls.  It wasn't all that intriguing, but at the same time, I thought it interesting to watch the reaction of the people around me.  Everyone was hoping that the U.S. would end up in a game against Mexico, but it didn't happen.  Schade, because that would be fun to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also pretty cool that Germany was picked for the opening game.  I'm sure it's going to be crazy and I'm really looking forward to it.  Germany will also be playing a game here in Berlin, so I'm hoping to get tickets for that game...at least I will have some sort of association rather than blindly cheering for a team I have no sort of feelings for.  However, I wouldn't really care if I wound up seeing a game that I don't care about either team, because it would just be an experience to go to a World Cup game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night before Alex and I went to a movie with Meredith and Zoey, we watched TV with Christian, Pablo, and Sebastian.  It was this program called &lt;a href="http://www.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/27/0,1872,1001627,00.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wetten, Dass...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Bet That...&lt;/span&gt;) which I think we need to import to the U.S.  To put it simply, it's Letterman's Stupid Human Tricks but an entire show.  The twist to it is that they have all these celebrities on, and then they bet the celebrity about the stupid trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stupid tricks last night included a guy who could name any Beatles tune being played by three guys with brooms and a kid, when blindfolded, who could tell you what stuffed animal was in front of him by feeling it with his barefeet.  I'd like to comment on these, um, "talents," if you will.  First, the guy &amp; The Beatles songs with brooms.  How the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;hell&lt;/span&gt; do you figure out you have a talent like that?  Do you practice Beatles songs with brooms?  And &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;why&lt;/span&gt; would you do either?  I guess it could be a pretty interesting pick up line:  "Yeah, so I can name any Beatles tune that is played with brooms...how many people do &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; know that can do that?"  Regardless, I guess it was a pretty unique talent, and ziemlich geil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the kid who could identify his stuffed animals by feeling them with his feet.  Um, three words:  What. The. Fuck.  Seriously!  What sort of child sits around and feels his stuffed animals with his &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;barefeet&lt;/span&gt;?  Does he have any friends?  Or do his friends indulge in this strange behavior as well?  Christian, Alex, and I were definitely making fun of him.  I mean, what kind of "talent" is that?  If I were the kid's mother, I would be worried if he just sat at home all day feeling stuffed animals with his feet.  That's just weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I would like to comment about last night's episode of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wetten, Dass...&lt;/span&gt; is Robbie Williams.  He was on performing, and God only knows why he is so popular here.  The people in the audience were going NUTS for him, as if it were just like Beatlemania.  I mean, girls were crying and screaming and tearing out their hair practically.  I'll admit it wasn't nearly as maniacal as with The Beatles, but it was pretty close.  He walked around the audience while performing, singing "to" people, taking pictures with their cameras, etc.  During the performance, I just had to say, "Ich verstehe nicht, warum Robbie Williams so populär ist.  Er ist SO langweilig!"  (I don't understand why Robbie Williams is so popular.  He's SO boring!)  Everyone just sort of laughed and agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for anyone who is coming to Germany any time soon, be warned: Robbie Williams is &lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;EVERYWHERE&lt;/span&gt;.  He's taking over Europe, apparently.  I keep thinking, "Robbie Williams...he's that dude that sang that song 'Millenium' and 'Angels.'  Why is he so great?"  He's on posters, advertisments, commercials, etc.  He's even playing the Olympiastadion here in Berlin, which would be the equivalent of playing Giants Stadium at home.  If Robbie Williams had a concert in the U.S., I feel like he would be lucky to fill Jones Beach Amphitheater.  It's so strange to think that Robbie Williams is actually popular...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently listening to Nerf Herder's "Pantera Fans In Love"&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/113431606125431838/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=113431606125431838&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113431606125431838'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113431606125431838'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/12/final-draw-wm-2006wetten-dass.html' title='The Final Draw - WM 2006/Wetten, Dass...'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-113346756499094943</id><published>2005-12-01T20:32:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2005-12-01T21:13:48.103+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Christmas Time is Here....Again.</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/28/68062942_dcfd1bab52.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 282px; height: 212px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/28/68062942_dcfd1bab52.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Once again, I have some more pics to post, and stuff to say, so here goes. This weekend I went with Nils to a flea market over at Prenzlauerberg, where Alex met up with us. It was really great because you could find every and anything you could think of, from old German board games to ugly furniture from the 1970's. I managed to get a Christmas present for my dad, which I hope he likes, but I'm not going to say what it is here in case for some reason he actually does end up reading it. It's really a hit or miss, but I guess you can't really go to a flea market ("Floh Markt") with anything super specific in mind. Apparently this market runs year round, but I'm not so sure about that, considering that it gets really "Arschkalt."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd just like to digress on the word "Arschkalt" for a second. Christian taught me it, and it literally means "ass cold." Basically, it means it's fucking cold out. I didn't believe him when he said it and thought he was totally bullshitting me, but it is now one of my favorite words. I try to use it whenever possible: "Is it Arschkalt outside?" "I think it's going to be Arschkalt tomorrow." "It's Arschkalt now." Of course, it doesn't sound nearly as great in English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/30/68062809_42ecc387ed.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 252px; height: 189px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/30/68062809_42ecc387ed.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;Topographie des Terrors &amp; part of the Berlin Wall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But back on track: Other things I did this weekend included going to the Topographie des Terrors (aka old SS headquarters) with Alex, but it was just so Arschkalt (see, there I go again) that we couldn't read everything. More pics are up on &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;. I also went to a party with Christian where it was slightly awkward for me because I didn't know anyone and my conversation topics are limited by my languge skills. So then that's when I just got up and danced with the other four people that were dancing. Good music, though: Hot Hot Heat, Weezer, Le Tigre, Modest Mouse, Violent Femmes, etc. It was like a WRMC party in German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Christmas time, I've mentioned that the Weihnachtsmarkt over on the Ku'damm is amazing. And that, it is. I finally got around to bringing my camera around and taking some&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/34/69101392_5ca2939e64.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 221px; height: 295px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/34/69101392_5ca2939e64.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pictures. The best way to describe the atmosphere is like a carnival without the huge rides (ferris wheel, salt &amp; pepper shaker) with a holiday spirit and the scent of alcohol on the air from the numerous Glühwein stands. Glühwein is a malt wine, I think, and sort of tastes like a warm Sangria minus the fruit. That's the closest I can describe it, and I should be bringing home a bottle or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, yeah, the Weihnachtsmarkt doesn't really have anything super exciting as Christmas gifts, in my opinion. (The flea market was probably better and more unique) But the FOOD. I shared some zeppolis with Devin the other night walking through it. (Zeppolis or fried dough, whatever you call them, are called "Quarkbälle" here) I actually haven't walked through the market during the day, but I really love it at night because everything is lit up and it's a little colder, so you just feel so comfortable all bundled up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, there are more pics up on my Flickr account. It's sort of hard putting them up on the blog and trying to put the ones that are most representative of what I'm talking about. I'm just sticking a few on here at the end just because I really like them, and in case you don't want to look on Flickr. I'd also just like to add that I'm really getting into the holiday spirit and I'm looking forward to when Lannie comes to visit me.

However, everything fell together wonderfully; Alex and I made great mashed potatoes, Rob and his friend Dave made interesting sweet potatoes (marshmallows? What?) and Cam...well...Cam was absolutely brilliant. He made the turkey, green beans wrapped in ham, stuffing, corn pudding, carrots, and pumpkin pie. One of his roommates, Joanna, made the cranberry sauce and apple pie, which were both delicious. I was certainly impressed with everything because not only did it look good, it tasted amazing. I know, all the pictures that I have are of empty plates rather than how good the food looked, but that just means it was really tasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/34/66821678_dd9ccf0b76.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 214px; height: 284px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/34/66821678_dd9ccf0b76.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today I went over to Cam's again so that we could make soup out of the leftover turkey carcass. We didn't finish it by the time I left, but we did manage to make a tasty turkey broth, which is a good start. I'll probably end up going to Cam's pretty often between now and whenever we finish the soup. After all, he does have my large pot to use. And there is always turkey soup at the end of Thanksgiving, which always signals the beginning of the Christmas season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Speaking of Christmas season, today was the first day it snowed and it was gorgeous. What a &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/32/66822206_77bff9ab58.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 245px; height: 326px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/32/66822206_77bff9ab58.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;great way to wake up the day after Thanksgiving. I'm posting a picture of the view outside my window with the low cloud coverage and snow, though you can see more snowy pictures on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee"&gt;Flickr account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this weekend I'm going to some markets with Nils. The Christmas markets here are simply amazing and there just isn't anything like it that I've experienced before. Sure, the Macy's windows in NYC are fantastic, but just walking through the Weihnachten Markt on the Ku'damm is the embodiment of Winter Wonderland. Everything just seems so bright and cheerful. I should take pictures of it, and when I do, I'll be posting them. Oh, and still on the topic of pictures, I went to London last week and there are pictures up from there. Nothing super interesting, except for the fact that there was a food stand in Stansted Airport called "Lovejuice." (I kid you not)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm posting some other random pictures on here because I thought the buildings/art was interesting. That's one thing I absolutely love about Berlin: You can find art everywhere...street art, performance art (though Cam has a great story about that), etc. The graffiti is not just graffiti, and I find myself stopping to look at walls with stuff on it. &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/32/66821864_38f8649200.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 194px; height: 259px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/32/66821864_38f8649200.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Take for example this building on the left that I saw walking around Friedrichshain with Cam. I'm also posting another picture which I took on the way walking to his apartment. I really need to walk around the city more because there are so many nooks and crannies, just like Thomas's English muffins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know anyone who is reading this is most likely too lazy to post a comment (which is perfectly ok), but I took some pictures that I posted on my Flickr account that I think might be worthwhile seeing.  So, if you're not doing anything after reading this sort of pointless post, look at my pictures.  I'm lazy enough that I'm not going to post them anywhere else (ie: Facebook).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/113294330749754979/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=113294330749754979&amp;isPopup=true' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113294330749754979'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113294330749754979'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/11/thanksgivinggerman-style.html' title='Thanksgiving...German Style.'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-113213802541440401</id><published>2005-11-16T11:21:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2005-11-16T11:47:05.433+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Sometimes, firsts aren't that great.</title><content type='html'>As my last entry was my first time in a German club, this entry will entail yet another first.  However, it's not a "Yeah, it was great my first time" type story.  No, my friends, this is one of those firsts that I'd rather not have happened.  And what is it?  I missed my flight to London.  Yes, for all of you who know me, I'm always punctual, usually showing up 15 minutes before necessary, but this time, I missed my flight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up 2 hours beforehand and left my apartment with an hour to spare to get to the airport. Christian and Pablo (my roommates) said that it shouldn't take me more than 30 to 40 minutes to get to Berlin Schönefeld.  I figured I'd still be early.  Well, I was standing at the Warschauer Straße S-bahnhof when the S9 to Schönefeld shows up at a not-so-great-time of 8:25 a.m.  My flight was at 9:40 and I started to panic.  Final check-in closed at 9:00 a.m.  Would I make it?  I hoped so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get to the airport at around 9:05 and try to find the check-in desk for RyanAir.  All I saw was German Wings.  RyanAir?  Anybody?  I finally just cut the X-ray line, mumbled a panicked and rushed, "Es tut mir Leid" (Sorry), and ran to the counter, blurted out to the guy behind the desk, "I know I'm late for my flight, but can I still get on???"  He shook his head and said, "London Stansted?  Sorry, final check-in closed 15 minutes ago."  I asked if I could get on the next flight and he directed me to the RyanAir office on the next floor down.  He added, "You're not the only one who missed the flight" and gave me this sorry look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went downstairs and saw absolutely NO office for RyanAir and I had to ask Information twice about what they meant.  The "office" was really this door that said "Virgin Express" (as in, Virgin Atlantic, which confused the hell out of me) and there were four of us that had missed the flight.  One German, two Brits, and me (the American).  I wound up paying an extra 60€ for my flight out tonight, and the woman behind the desk really stressed, "Check-in is at 7:55 and we &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;highly&lt;/span&gt; recommend that you check-in two hours beforehand."  Thanks, you don't need to rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it's about 9:30 a.m. when I have my flight rebooked, and I'm thinking, "Hmm, what should I do?"  Well, I might as well go home.  I called Chris to tell him I missed my flight (did I feel stupid?  Just a wee bit), and then I called Alex and bitched to her about my life.  Yesterday public transporation wasn't working for me, either, but that's a whole different story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got back onto the S-bahn and sat down, and this guy a few seats away says, "Missed the flight to Stansted too?"  I moved my seat across from him and we had a nice chat back into central Berlin.  Turns out he's taking the flight tonight, too, so I'll probably see him later.   He's also only been learning German for about 2 months now, so we conversed in English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weirdest thing happened on the train, though.  This little old lady boards and says to me (in German), "I want to sit there."  I thought she meant the empty seat next to me, so I got up so she could sit down.  Instead, she took the seat that I was sitting in!  There was an older German man who said to her angrily (in German), "There are other seats on the train!  Why do you have to take the one she's sitting in?  What's wrong with you?  Look at how many seats there are!"  (Which was true)  I was like, ok, whatever, lady, take the seat.  I sat down next to Miko (the British guy) and we continued talking in English.  He left at Ostkreuz Bahnhof, which was one stop before I wanted to get off at Warschauer Straße, and once he got off, the little old lady (who was now sitting across from me), was eyeing me with really narrow eyes.  Eyeing my shoes, the bottom of my pants, my coat, and finally she was just staring at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got off with my very tiny luggage at Warschauer Straße, brought it up the stairs, and started rolling it.  The little old lady had apparently gotten off at the same stop and as she walked by me, I think I heard something along the lines of "Verpisst dich!" (Fuck you) or something else.  I didn't even know what to say...I was going to say, "Arschloch" (Asshole) or, "Hast du ein Problem mit mir?" but I was just speechless.  What the hell did this woman have against me?  I didn't do jack SHIT to her.  I mean, c'mon, lady, you took my fucking seat, not the other way around.  And the other people on the train thought it was rude, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...I guess that is just another asshole person just giving Germans a bad reputation.  I came back to my apartment where Christian asked in German, "Uh, aren't you supposed to be on a flight?"  I told him the whole story, including the little old lady, and he was like, "Yeah, crazy people in Berlin, can't really do anything about them."  I told him she knew what she was doing (she seemed &lt;span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"&gt;intent&lt;/span&gt;, not as if she was some crazy just being), and he apologized for it.  Not that it was his fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I have almost 10 hours until my flight to London.  I'm looking at it positively, saying that I am spending less money for the 60€ than what I would pay for by being in London.  And I can be productive by doing some reading for class.  Berlin's not that bad...it's just one day short of time in London, and considering it's my fifth time there, not a HUGE loss.  At least I'm not missing Harry Potter, and at least I didn't get tickets for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Guys and Dolls&lt;/span&gt;.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/113213802541440401/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=113213802541440401&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113213802541440401'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113213802541440401'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/11/sometimes-firsts-arent-that-great.html' title='Sometimes, firsts aren&apos;t that great.'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-113125221758703046</id><published>2005-11-06T05:16:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2005-11-06T05:43:37.603+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>My German Club Virginity Has Been Lost</title><content type='html'>As I write this, I would like to note a few things.  First, it's 5:20 am and I got home about 20 minutes ago.  Second, the adrenaline is still running, which leads me to my third point of why I'm writing this now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night started off relatively quiet: I cooked dinner for Nils (my "tandem partner," aka language partner) and my two roommates.  It was pretty simple; I just threw together some pasta sauce by adding some garlic, tomatoes, chicken, and some spices.  Alex came over but didn't eat anything (she hates tomatoes...Schade!), and we all watched some crazy German TV together.  There was this little kindergartner who could recognize single puzzle pieces, so the host of this show just pulled random puzzle pieces and asked him, "What's this from?"  It was something you would see on Letterman as a stupid human trick, and all the little boy would say is "Ja."  I said to Alex, "Hey, that's like us!  Just 'ja' and everything is good!" to which she answered, "Yeah, now I can understand him!"  Sad, but true.  (Ok, a bit of an exaggeration, but nonetheless, close to the truth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex, Nils, and I left my apartment at around 10 and went to Cam's housewarming in Friedrichshain.  We met some other Americans there (Zoey and Devin came later), a few Germans, and a weird Croatian.  This Croatian guy was just all over the place and I know Alex, Zoey, and I just wanted to say, "Dude, chill out...calm down..."  Nils left early, and then Zoey and Devin went to a club in Friedrichshain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with Alex to Club 103 in Kreuzberg and met up with some people from my film history class, Julian, this-girl-whose-name-I-really-need-to-see-to-remember, and Julian's friend (a guy, but also named) Alex from Nürnberg.  Alex's feet were hurting from the silly shoes she was wearing, so she only stayed for about a half hour before she left.  The rest of the night, however, was chock full of dancing to techno and speaking German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't mind the music selection and I must admit that it grew on me as the night went on.  I think the highlight of the night was a techno version of the Kaiser Chiefs' song, "Every Day I Love You Less and Less."  It was especially cool because only a few minutes before, Julian, Alex, the girl, and I were talking about how we liked the Kaiser Chiefs.  So it made it that much more exciting.  Another musical highlight of the night was this techno band (?) of three guys that played a lot of stuff.  Can't tell you what exactly it was, but it certainly was very danceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We managed to sit down and have a nice talk about various things, ranging from favorite movies to experiencing anti-American sentiments.  I think the most interesting topic was when they asked me about 9/11.  At that point, I just couldn't truly express what happened due to my lack of vocabulary.  I think they understood me, and even so, I think they were really interested in what I had to say.  I also found it interesting that they think Germany may be the next target for terrorism, after the bombings in Madrid and London.  Let's hope that doesn't happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, I must say it was indeed a very good night.  When we left the club at around 4:45 a.m., the music was still going strong, the dancing was still happening, and the drinks were still being sold, but we found ourselves in the crisp, clear night sneaking back home into the warmth of our beds.  (Though I'm still not in mine yet)  I never thought I would say this, but I really enjoyed clubbing.  A lot of dancing was done, a lot of German was spoken (and in my opinion, not too badly!), and a good amount of alcohol was consumed.  My eyes are growing heavy, and the adrenaline is coming down, but I will say this:  I think a lot more clubbing will be done this year than previously thought.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/113125221758703046/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=113125221758703046&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113125221758703046'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113125221758703046'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/11/my-german-club-virginity-has-been-lost.html' title='My German Club Virginity Has Been Lost'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-113095732979835130</id><published>2005-11-02T18:59:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2005-11-03T00:08:40.626+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Endlich: Ich habe eingezogen!</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/27/59035039_3ed6ced983.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/27/59035039_3ed6ced983.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally moved into my apartment yesterday with the help of Meredith and Alex. (Pic on the left is the view from my window with the U-bahn going by.) I don't think it could've went any easier, either. We took the bus one stop to Schlesisches Tor from Meredith's, then took the U-bahn one stop to Görlitzer Bahnhof. We walked the block or so to where I will be living until April 30th, when I have to move out. The room I am renting belongs to a 30-year-old law student, and I think she is away for the 6 months because she has studies to do of some sort. I'm living with two German guys, Pablo and Christian, so it will be good for using my German. I feel as if within the past two days that I've been here, I've used my German more than the whole month that Alex and I were in the hotel, but even so, it's a bit awkward still since I'm the "new roommate." Not to mention that I've been completely retarded and can't manage to open the damn door to the apartment. It's pretty difficult and I am determined to be able to open it by tomorrow evening on my own. (Yes, Pablo &amp; Christian have both had to let me in, even though I have the key)&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/25/59035032_833c41296d.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/25/59035032_833c41296d.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The past few days have been relatively uneventful otherwise, to say the least. I went to Ikea with Cam today and bought sheets and a pillow for my bed. I kept telling Christian that I was going to Ikea (pronouncing it "eye-key-ah") and seeing that he was confused, I said, "ee-key-ah?" which solved the problem. Oh, Ikea. No matter where you go in the world, as long as there is Ikea, there is cheap furniture and bedding to be bought. This other picture is of my room, but the furniture came with the room. It's not mine, obviously...But yeah. Ikea went well and Cam helped me pick out which pillow. I never realized that there were so many to choose from, but apparently there is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;I also went real grocery shopping and spent 20€ at Plus. I probably could've spent less if I hadn't bought bottles of shampoo &amp; conditioner, but whatever, 20€ is still pretty good. I still find it really strange to have to bring your &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/27/59035034_ebb4eaed85.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/27/59035034_ebb4eaed85.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;own canvas bags if you don't want to pay for another canvas bag or for a plastic bag. Germans are super environmentally friendly, I noticed, with the exception of my roommates who don't seperate their garbage like everyone else. The canvas bag I have says "Schützt unsere Umwelt!" (Protect our environment) with a turtle and a frog kissing under a rainbow. (And this next picture is the living room)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some random observations about Berlin that I've made within the past month:&lt;br /&gt;1. Everyone at home has a twin here. I've seen numerous people on the street almost thinking that they were someone from home. I'm not sure why this seems to be the case, but seriously. Both of my roommates strongly remind me of students at Middlebury.&lt;br /&gt;2. Berlin is the smallest big city. I see the same people all the time on public transporation (ie: U-bahn, S-bahn), and it's not even at the same time. How is it possible? I have no idea. It's also really easy to run into people you know on the street. Doesn't happen often in New York.&lt;br /&gt;3. People are really cuddly and openly affectionate here. Call me a prude, but I don't want to see people making out on the U-bahn (which has happened lots of times before). Seriously, whether it's a heterosexual or gay couple, there will be a lot of kissing, ass-grabbing, really intense eye contact, etc. involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that's it for now.  I've made other observations, but nothing worth writing about.  I found these interesting.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/113095732979835130/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=113095732979835130&amp;isPopup=true' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113095732979835130'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/113095732979835130'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/11/endlich-ich-habe-eingezogen.html' title='Endlich: Ich habe eingezogen!'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>5</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112997998696166624</id><published>2005-10-22T12:57:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2005-10-22T13:19:46.970+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Breaking Down Stereotypes...or not.</title><content type='html'>So as I am here in Berlin, I am learning where the German stereotypes come from.  Some of them have been broken down.  For example, everyone thinks that Germans are highly organized and efficient.  My thoughts:  Yes, this is true, but only to an extent.  Take a look at the whole system of signing up for classes.  In my opinion, I don't find it efficient at all, nor do I find it organized.  Showing up to a class that has been cancelled until November 4 and having no prior notice is not what I would call efficient. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another stereotype is that Germans can be very cold people, or rather, very rude.  I suppose this is true for just about any nationality (Americans are loud &amp; obnoxious, the French are pushy, the Chinese are pushy in a different way, etc.  So it all is some form of being rude), but for the Germans, I am understanding why it seems to be true in some instances.  When Alex, Cam, Rob, and I went to the movies, we had to pick our seats when we bought the tickets.  (I met Rob through the Middlebury Language School and met Cam through Rob here.)  When we got to the theater, our seats were occupied, and the woman there was snippy, to say the least.  She basically told us it doesn't matter where your tickets say you sit, but it was in a very abrupt manner that came off as being, well, bitchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think last night epitomizes what someone would think of "German rudeness."  I don't mean to offend anyone, but the guy we encountered last night was just a dick.  I don't usually use that to describe people, especially in writing.  However, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex, Cam, Devin (she goes to Sarah Lawrence but is going through the Midd program), and I were standing outside this bar, The Pip's, waiting for Zoey and Meredith.  Alex had a beer in her hand and was finishing it before we went inside, so the 4 of us were just standing around talking.  Devin said, "Hey, there's a guy standing in the window giving us looks."  Cam, Alex, and I turned around not so subtly to see this man giving us dirty looks from a second story window.  (Which is actually considered the first floor here, but regardless.)  He left the window and we continued to chat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And suddenly water just fell out of the sky.  Not rain, but a bucket's worth.  We all turned around again to see the guy in the window, and indeed, it was a bucket's worth of water.  When we looked, the guy threw &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;another&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; bucket of water on us.  As if one wasn't enough?  He hadn't even shouted anything to the extent of "Shut up" or "Go away," and it wouldn't have even mattered if it was in a foreign language because we would've understood the tone.  No forewarning of any kind.  After the two buckets were thrown on us, other Germans walking by just shouted, "Arschloch!" and whatever, which was very kind of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, so this just furthers the stereotype of being rude.  I realize that this guy was just a total asshole anyway, but who seriously throws &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 buckets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of water on people, when it is only 11 pm on a Friday night in a neighborhood that is filled with bars?  Additionally, he didn't even say anything!  Could we get more passive aggressive?  If you don't want to hear people outside talking at night, don't live near a bar, jack ass.  Perhaps I would be a little more understanding if it was 2 am and he gave some sort of forewarning, but it wasn't the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on a completely different note, I suggest that everyone read &lt;a href="http://alexberlinfall05.blogspot.com/"&gt;Alex's blog &lt;/a&gt;entry for today (Oct. 22, titled "Honestly, wouldn't one bucket have sufficed?").  She wrote out some funny stories that Cam told us last night and they are pretty funny.  I've come to the conclusion that Cam is probably one of the most quotable people, orelse he just has the most ridiculous stories.  I'm not sure which.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/112997998696166624/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=112997998696166624&amp;isPopup=true' title='8 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112997998696166624'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112997998696166624'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/10/breaking-down-stereotypesor-not.html' title='Breaking Down Stereotypes...or not.'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112982077437987538</id><published>2005-10-20T16:45:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2005-10-21T16:54:33.080+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Oh, How I Miss Bannerweb</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://static.flickr.com/27/52690299_fc2f2db47e.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; float: left; width: 320px;" alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/27/52690299_fc2f2db47e.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://static.flickr.com/32/52085882_fe1f1bfd14.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I have come to the conclusion that I miss that P.O.S. software called Bannerweb that we use back at Middlebury to sign up for classes. Yes, it crashes sometimes. Yes, it may lock you out so that you can't get that class with Mark Southern. Yes, it can be slow when you need it go faster. But damn, those are the things I miss and now can fully appreciate. Bannerweb does this amazing little thing called a "practice round." You can see what classes you want to sign up for, where they are, how many spaces are available, who teaches the course, when it is, how often it meets, and everything you basically need to know about classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Shopping" for classes is nearly as stressful as finding an apartment. I don't know how many credits I'd be receiving and the course catalog isn't the least bit helpful. For example, I didn't realize that all the film courses come in mandatory pairs. All I know is that I need to get 4 credits from the Middlebury Schools Abroad...but, as it turns out, I can take the mandatory pair of film courses and get 2 credits for it. Sweet. Makes my life a little easier...but...the problem is not just with getting credit, but if it will count towards my major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may not be able to get credit for taking Film History here, even though the course here entails more work than at Midd. I emailed the current head of the film department, and he said that he is not willing to give me credit. Thankfully, I had emailed the department head (good ol' Ted Perry) last year and had asked him if I could take film history abroad. And thankfully, he said yes, and even more thankfully, I kept that email. So I can tell the current department head, "Well, Ted Perry said I could do it, so there. Ha!" Which I might actually (not) do. In the end, to make it simplified, I may be taking 5 courses this semester (though 2 count as 1 in Middlebury's eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://static.flickr.com/29/52690345_65efa11f8f.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; width: 213px; height: 262px; text-align: center;" alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/29/52690345_65efa11f8f.jpg" border="0" height="342" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt; Some building at the FU that I don't use, but I took the picture because it says Freie Universität on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've already picked 2 classes: Political Culture in the French Revolution and Comics in History --History in Comics?. Both of the professors are really nice people and easy to understand, and of course the topics sound really interesting. I'm taking the one on the French Revolution because the professor seemed chill and I don't know that much about the topic. The comics class just seemed really different and something I wouldn't be able to take when I get back to Midd. (Yes, Bennigans, I know that you took a class on cartoons, but that was during J Term, and well, I don't think I have a J Term class left, especially if I do a thesis...scary.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So all in all, this week has been a bit of a bust because of the film courses. Oh, and they start next week, too, unlike the rest of the university. (Who knew? Bannerweb would know that...I miss Bannerweb) Nobody told me that the 8 film courses I took start next week so I should've been attending history or politic or some other subjects' classes. Totally sucks. I also sat in on an art history course by accident that I wouldn't take even if I was interested because it was the same exact course I took back at Midd, just in German. In conclusion, I would just like you all to know: Appreciate Bannerweb. It does a lot, even though you may think it's a huge piece of crap. Alex and I started a Facebook group called "Going Abroad Made Me Realize Bannerweb is the Best Thing that Ever Happened to Me," so feel free to join.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/112982077437987538/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=112982077437987538&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112982077437987538'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112982077437987538'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/10/oh-how-i-miss-bannerweb.html' title='Oh, How I Miss Bannerweb'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112956602885606200</id><published>2005-10-17T18:02:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2005-10-17T18:20:28.866+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Der Erste Tag</title><content type='html'>I survived.  The first day of classes.  Well, ok, it was one class´about the French Revolution.  I probably will not even take it because I will most likely end up taking more film courses.  The professor was really nice and the class already has a 10 page paper built into it already (Hausarbeit), so it's not a problem that I will have to write 12 pages (of course, depending on if I take the course). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the class started, I was unbelievably nervous.  My hands were shaking and I just kept reminding myself to breathe.  I mean, I know it's just another class, but it's in another language.  The first thing the professor asked was "Was ist politische Kultur?"  I could possibly explain myself in English, but in German?  Good question.  Was IST politische Kultur?  Got me...in German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The class felt very much like a discussion class back at Middlebury:  There wasn't more than 12 students, we sat around desks set up in a large square, and the professor was laid back and sitting, too.  What the professor talked about mostly was a very brief introduction to the course and just answering his one question of "Was ist politische Kultur."  I was surprised at the amount that I understood and as forgetful as I am out of nerves, I had forgotten my English-German pocket dictionary, so it was even better than I thought.  Out of the entire class, there were only 3 international students including myself.  The other two were two French guys (the only reason why I knew was because they whipped out a French-German dictionary that had a large French flag on it) who I am sure know a lot about the Revolution.  Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the class, I had to approach the professor and ask him if it was ok that I write a 12 page paper instead of a 10, introduce myself, and tell him that I am with the Middlebury program.  I was so nervous that I used the informal you form (du instead of Sie), which I was later kicking myself for.  I asked him if he was familiar with the Midd program and he just sort of gave me this look, then asked, "Is that in Vermont, between the mountains and in the really pretty valley?"  Apparently he was there last summer.  Perhaps with the Language Schools, I didn't ask.  He was very nice and didn't seemed fazed that I used the wrong "you" form (Thank God, otherwise I would definitely NOT take the class).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hurrah, the first day is over.  It's always the hardest.  Tomorrow I have three classes to go to: 2 film ones (both are taught by the same woman) and 1 history one (which I'm excited about the title: "Comics in History - History in Comics?").  No idea what ones I will take, but regardless, I am glad that the first day is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and for the Fair Lawn people reading my blog...I just heard that a certain Vicky from the class of 2003 has become a stripper.  With her best friend that is a year younger than us.  I'm not giving specific names, just in case this is googled or something.  All I can say is I can't wait til 5 year reunion.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/112956602885606200/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=112956602885606200&amp;isPopup=true' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112956602885606200'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112956602885606200'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/10/der-erste-tag.html' title='Der Erste Tag'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112931374314961845</id><published>2005-10-14T19:56:00.001+02:00</published><updated>2008-09-18T15:33:18.409+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Remembering Germany's Past</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/28/52690651_645235c54d.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 222px; height: 296px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/28/52690651_645235c54d.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am deleting everything that I wrote the other night because it was so ridiculously scatterbrained.

I actually could only figure my way to the part of the museum that I.M.Pei designed because I didn't see any maps to lead me around. (Picture on the right is where I was) I'll eventually figure my way over to the Zeighaus, which is the older part of the museum. The part the I.M. Pei designed houses the temporary exhibitions, so I stayed in this one exhibit titled &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Der Krieg und seine Folgen 1945: Kriegsende und Erinnerungspolitik in Deutschland&lt;/span&gt; (Translation: The War &amp;amp; Its Consequences 1945: The End of the War and Politics of Rememberance). It was absolutely fascinating because it dealt with how Germany changed after the end of World War II, from 1945 until present day. The exhibit was actually only supposed to last through August, but it's been extended until October 23.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the feeling that many Americans think that the Germans sort of try hiding the past, but that's not true at all. The Germans were affected by Hitler's regime just as much as any other country and they, too, had to deal with the aftermath. Much of the country was left in ruins, many women were left husbandless, children were orphaned, and the country was split into &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/24/52690385_124c8f2fc6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/24/52690385_124c8f2fc6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;quadrants. Seeing it from this perspective has really made me realize that Germany has struggled with its past in the sense that they could not really be patriotic like Americans, because the rest of the world saw it as coming too close to Nazism. I suppose it will only be a matter of time before that is all changed with younger generations, but the past will surely not be forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture on the left is one I took while walking on Unter den Linden, one of the main roads here in Berlin. It is where the Deutsches Historisches Museum is, along with Humboldt Universität, the Deutsche Guggenheim, and a good amount of other museums. It's the Fernsehen Turm and I have no idea what the other pretty building is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a completely different note, I am beginning to feel more comfortable here. Granted I have not been speaking nearly as much German as I should be, but considering classes will be starting on Monday and I will be &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/32/52690220_3564b8fe3e.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 214px; height: 283px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/32/52690220_3564b8fe3e.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;moving into my apartment in about two weeks, I feel like I'm getting to know the city better. I am remembering the U-bahn and S-bahn systems better and I don't constantly have to pull out a map. Tomorrow I will be going back to the FU to make sure I know my way around on Monday. I'm including a picture of the Silberlaube in this post, which in my opinion is extraordinarily ugly. The Silberlaube is essentially the student center, I think. (Dan, if you're reading this, I think the Doshisha University is probably a million times prettier than this one building that is central to the FU.) Isn't it awful looking? David, another MiddKid who was here in the past, described it as the "big, ugly, silver building that you can't miss" in a packet he wrote for us on where to go look for housing advertisments. I think he is completely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last thing that I would like to post about today is regarding beer. Yes, I am in Germany, and yes, beer is part of the culture here. Like I have said in an earlier post, it is strange to see prepubescent kids on the streets urging each other on to chug a half liter bottle of beer. Today was my first experience buying beer from a supermarket because I offered to bring some beer to my friend Rob's place tonight. &lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/28/52690738_9685c2c396.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 212px; height: 283px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/28/52690738_9685c2c396.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alex and I went to Kaiser's in Wittendorfplatz, which is down the street from our hotel. When people at home told me, "Yeah, beer is cheaper than water over in Germany!," I thought they were kidding. No, everyone who told me that was in fact 100% correct. And to prove it, I am posting my receipt for the three half liter bottles of beer that I bought. One can see Hasseroeder (0.59€), Holsten Pils (0.55€), and Paulaner (0.60€), with an 8 cent deposit on each one. The last item on the receipt, the DW Tasche, was a canvas bag I bought in order to carry the beer back with me. (That is one thing that is very different here: You have to buy the plastic bags for your groceries, or buy canvas bags and reuse them. Canvas bags are useful, so I figured I should buy one.) And yes, you can see that the canvas bag cost me 1.00€, which is more expensive than one bottle of beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;1.   I will be trying a lot of beer this year and there are a lot of beers to try.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Beer is in fact cheaper than water, but of course not healthier.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The Germans are really all about saving the environment with using canvas bags for everything.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/112931374314961845/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=112931374314961845&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112931374314961845'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112931374314961845'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/10/remembering-germanys-past.html' title='Remembering Germany&apos;s Past'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112915165013079278</id><published>2005-10-12T22:54:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2005-10-12T23:14:10.140+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Berlin photos</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/26/51896817_154643dbbb_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/26/51896817_154643dbbb_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Due to the joys of wireless, I am able to post some pictures that I've taken over the past few days.  (Basically, I turned on my computer to listen to the new Franz Ferdinand CD, and lo and behold, my computer picked up a wireless signal.)  So here on the left is a picture from when Alex and I stopped by Checkpoint Charlie, which was where you could cross into the American sector of Berlin into the Russian sector.  I have more pictures by it, but I thought this one is just one of those things that you always see in history books.  It was pretty surreal seeing it in real life, but at the same time, it was a total tourist trap and there were a ton of people just everywhere buying postcards, replica hats, etc.  There is also a very different feel between the two sides.  You could definitely see the buildings on the eastern side were newer because the old ones were knocked down.  Even today you could feel the difference although it is now one city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt; &lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/30/51946610_7d653ba907.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/30/51946610_7d653ba907.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here on the left you can see a picture that I took of part of the East Side Gallery, which is a lot of street art on part of the Berlin Wall that was left.  I think I took 50-some odd pictures over at the East Side Gallery, but you can check them out on my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee"&gt;Flickr Account&lt;/a&gt;.  I didn't load all of them yet, and I also am lazy, so I didn't rotate some of the pictures that should be rotated.  You get the general idea, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then below is a picture of a bridge that Alex and I walked across to get to the East Side Gallery from the western side of the river.  (Not sure which river it was...sorry.)  It's a bridge you cross from Kreuzberg to Friedrichshain, which are two neighborhoods that are the equivalent of the Lower East Side and the Village.  The detail that some of the buildings and infrastructure here have is truly amazing and it is very unique.  It makes me wonder why we couldn't have stuff like that at home, but I suppose that's what characterizes Germany and the U.S. as the U.S.  I have more pictures from the bridge, too, and I think they are also on my Flickr account.  The last picture is also of Checkpoint Charlie.  I apologize that there really isn't any sort of order to the pictures that I am posting on my blog, but oh well, you will just have to deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://static.flickr.com/24/51944674_0af16baa24_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 276px; height: 207px;" src="http://static.flickr.com/24/51944674_0af16baa24_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Oh...and if you're actually reading my blog...post a comment...I feel as if nobody reads it.

We essentially sat around for a long time reviewing what we had already read through in the handbook (the only difference was that it was in German) and eating in this Italian restaurant in the Student Center.  (Or something.)  I can't say it was honestly helpful because I felt as if I missed a lot of what was said, orelse I already knew what was being said because of the handbook.  So either way, I still feel quite confused about the whole process of finding classes.  To be perfectly honest, and I never thought I would ever say this in my life, I think I miss Bannerweb.  For those of you who do not know what Bannerweb is, it's what we use at Midd to register for classes online which frequently has crashing problems as you register.  Bannerweb is easy, though it may kick you of the system at a crucial time or the like, and it is straightforward.  I'm not so sure about having this process of "shopping for classes."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think I was the only one to feel confused, as we all looked at each other and asked, "Did you get that?" or "Wait, is this what was meant?"  To sum it up using Zoey's quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I am &lt;em&gt;SO&lt;/em&gt; over this Deutsch bullshit."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is funny, especially because I am going to be here for a whole year.  In the end, putting it into perspective makes the year not seem TOO bad.  I will be confused, scared, and intimidated throughout first semester and second semester I will hopefully be confident and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The university is HUGE, especially in comparison to Middlebury.  I feel like I will get lost every day, and there is this whole system of finding rooms which confused me even further.  (Apparently there are addresses within the buildings...sort of.)  The buildings are pretty ugly, especially when you look at the cute little quaint buildings of that School on the Hill.  Founded in 1948, the Freie Universität looks like something out of the 1960s with bright colors popping out everywhere.  For those of you from home, I think it is way uglier than Fair Lawn High School's B-wing.  (Didn't think possible, but it seems the possibilities here are endless.)  I found it humorous that there was a JFK Building, as well as a Henry Ford Building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the up note, we got a catalog of "Hochschulsport," which is essentially just a bunch of workshops and classes that are for sports.  I think I really want to do a swing class (as in, swing dance, not playing swing) or perhaps a salsa class.  I already took ballroom dancing during J Term with Dan, but I think taking it in another language will be ridiculously embarassing (and thus make for good stories) and at the same time, loads of fun.  They also have a gymnastics class which I am very tempted to take, but considering I haven't done any gymnastics since oh, junior year of high school, I probably shouldn't.  (And even then nobody could spot me because I was too big.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in retrospect of today, I think it was a good day.  Alex and I will have eaten 3 meals by the end of the day and this is awesome because we've been cutting meals out to save money.  And Middlebury is paying us to eat out.  Always good.  Thanks, Middlebury.  I got the course catalog on CD from Katharina, one of the assistants, so Alex and I will have a good look at that.  Hopefully I will not be class-less by the time we actually have to choose classes.  And seeing the university...well...yes, I am intimidated, scared, and nervous, and it feels worse than being a freshman all over again at Middlebury, but it will be a life experience I can put under my belt and say, "Yes, I actually accomplished something in my life." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put simply, I am still taking one day at a time.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/112895235082570365/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=112895235082570365&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112895235082570365'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112895235082570365'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/10/die-universitt.html' title='Die Universität'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112878483527556859</id><published>2005-10-08T17:05:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2005-10-08T17:20:35.300+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Burrito In My Pocket</title><content type='html'>No, this post has nothing to do with burritos in my pocket, although Alex and I did have a discussion about that. (I did do that while I was at Middlebury though, last semester.) We had lunch at a Mexican place in Prenzlauerberg, which was surprisingly good. I didn't think I would find any Mexican restaurants on this side of the pond, but, well, we did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly to post on here is that I have &lt;em&gt;FINALLY&lt;/em&gt; found an apartment. After emailing nearly 90 people and making at least 30 calls (no exaggeration), I have found a place in Kreuzberg, which is similar to the Lower East Side in New York City.  I will be living with two German guys, Christian and Pablo.  Yes, Pablo.  Alex and I have discussed what cracked out German would give their son a Spanish name, but I will probably figure that out in the not-so-distant-future.  I won't be able to move in until November 1 because Heike, whose room I will be occupying, is not leaving until then.  I believe she is going abroad and will be back in May, when I will have to move out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not too concerned about having to move out because I've got it all figured out.  I can live on my own for the last two or three months while I am here in Berlin.  It won't be too long nor will it be too short, and people can't say, "Well, you should try living with people."  Of course, plans can change, but for now, I'm not thinking about that.  I think I will have to worry more about the fact that I am starting classes in 10 days and will be living in a hotel for the first three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the note of living in a hotel, I think that it will probably delay the culture shock which is sure to come.  I feel like a tourist rather than a student, and people still talk to me in English rather than German.  It's a bit frustrating, mostly because I feel like my vocabulary is slowly dwindling, even though I am here in Germany.  However, once classes start, German will be in full force and I will probably talk mostly in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So besides de-stressing because I have found a place to live, Alex and I went to Checkpoint Charlie and the East Side Gallery today.  It was bizarre seeing Checkpoint Charlie swarming with happy tourists, but I suppose it can be seen as two different symbols: a symbol of freedom and a symbol of division.  I guess when I think "Checkpoint Charlie" I think symbol of division, so I didn't take any pictures with Alex or me in them.  On the other hand, I took a ton of pictures over at the East Side Gallery, which is basically this long stretch of the Berlin Wall which has been left with lots of street art on it.  It was very powerful seeing some of the artwork and I think much more interesting than Checkpoint Charlie.  (Not to mention we didn't have to pay to get into a museum or anything, plus it was a gorgeous day outside.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to read something more eloquent on what we saw today, I suggest reading &lt;a href="http://alexberlinfall05.blogspot.com/"&gt;Alex's blog&lt;/a&gt;.  She's a more eloquent writer than I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So things I have accomplished so far in Berlin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Finding an apartment, after seeing about 12 and having more than 90 emails sent out.&lt;br /&gt;II.  Went to the Brandenburg Gate on the Tag der Einheit Deutschlands, having wurst, and drinking beer.  (And no, I have not gotten drunk.  Just red.)&lt;br /&gt;c.  Discovered the joy of döner kebabs.  And Alex has made many a joke on that.&lt;br /&gt;Four.  Begun to master the public transportation system of the U- and S-bahns.&lt;br /&gt;Fifth.  Been in an internet cafe more than I would like to admit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on that note...I guess I should end it here.  But yeah, I am not moving into my apartment until November 1, so I can't receive any regular mail until then.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/112878483527556859/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=112878483527556859&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112878483527556859'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112878483527556859'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/10/burrito-in-my-pocket.html' title='Burrito In My Pocket'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112867743638487156</id><published>2005-10-07T11:21:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2005-10-07T11:30:47.286+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>I am still Obdachlose.</title><content type='html'>I am still sitting in this beloved easyInternetcafe in the Zoologischer Garten and I am still homeless.  I have yet to find a place, but I am still looking.  I counted the number of emails I have sent out, which is 40 only in my Gmail account.  This doesn't count the number of emails I sent through websites themselves, so I guess the total would be around 90 or more.  And I've seen a total of 11 places, I think.  And not one prospect.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided that it is frustrating that my fate is being decided by complete strangers, whether they want me as a roommate or not.  I am coming very close to the decision that I should find an apartment by myself, although it would be lonely, and I'll be here for the entire year.  It might be easier, and I suppose I could just better my German in class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was talking with Alex, and I've also come to this conclusion:  There really isn't much time to live on your own.  Many people say, "You shouldn't live on your own, there is plenty of time to do that after college."  This might be true, but this is my thinking.  After college, it seems extraordinarily likely that one will move out and into an apartment with friends or with total strangers.  Perhaps a significant other.  And then after that, marriage forces you to live with your significant other, unless I am otherwise mistaken.  So when are you supposed to live on your own?  This is why I think it wouldn't be too bad living in an apartment by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the other thought that came to my mind was this PBS program I saw on why humans have this emotion called "empathy."  We are very sociable creatures, and empathy stems from the fact that we can imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes.  The fact that we are sociable creatures creates this desire to NOT be alone, to live with other humans.  So this is the downside of living by myself.  As much as I might think it'd be a great idea, in the end, I'd end up lonely.  On the other hand, I won't be homeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a frustrating process for me and I am still pushing on to find somewhere to live.  I know a lot of other people might have given up by now and decide to live in the Studentenwohnheim (dorms), but I really don't want to do that, especially because I am here for the year.  I am just hoping that where ever I find a place, I will be happy there, and that the people (if there are people) will be friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also looking forward to finding a place to live because then I can actually eat properly.  I feel like I haven't eaten a proper vegetable in almost 2 weeks.  I don't think in the past I would ever think this, but man, I miss vegetables.  And fruit.  Alex and I have been living on doener kebabs (read her blog, I'm sure she mentioned kebabs somewhere), which aren't bad, and actually are really dirt cheap and filling, but I just want some broccoli or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the search continues....</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/112867743638487156/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=112867743638487156&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112867743638487156'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112867743638487156'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/10/i-am-still-obdachlose.html' title='I am still Obdachlose.'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112833855421113102</id><published>2005-10-03T13:15:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2005-10-03T13:22:34.216+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>I live in an internet cafe.</title><content type='html'>So today is my fourth day here searching for an apartment or "Wohngemeinschaft" (WG) in an internet cafe.  I feel as if Alex, Zilai, and I are just living here.  I think we stay here for about 4 hours or more per day, emailing, calling, and running around the city to see various places.  I am starting to get accustomed to the keyboard here (like remembering the y and z are switched on it from the U.S.), but even so, I still make some mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weather is still basically cloudy.  I don't understand it, but it seems like Berlin really does have worse weather than London.  Didn't think it possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other observation I've made is that nobody here jay walks, as in, everywhere is clear, but the Germans wait until the pedestrian signal goes green.  I've jaywalked (I'm from the NYC area, what do you want!) and gotten heads shaken at me.  I guess everyone is not nearly in as big of a rush as they are back home, but even so, it will take some time to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is actually a national holiday here: Der Tag der Einheit Deutschlands.  15 years ago today the two Germanys were reunited into one nation.  I heard from our host that there might be stuff going on by the Brandenburg Gate, such as beer drinking (surprise, surprise) and eating (wurst, perhaps?).  I think we may try to go over there later after some appointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, there really isn't so much to say.  The 4 places I saw yesterday were really nice and the people are friendly.  Two of those places spoke in English with me (well, actually, one of them we spoke in English, German, and Spanish in one period of time!), and the others were completely in German.  It is still a process, but I am sure it will sink in in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The car with the Midd sticker still hasn't seen our note yet.  It's been sitting there since...Friday?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/112833855421113102/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=112833855421113102&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112833855421113102'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112833855421113102'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/10/i-live-in-internet-cafe.html' title='I live in an internet cafe.'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112817744829486726</id><published>2005-10-01T16:24:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2005-10-01T16:37:28.303+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Pictures!</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/1600/IMG_0554.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/320/IMG_0554.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/1600/Midd%20car.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/320/Midd%20car.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/1600/IMG_0572.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/320/IMG_0572.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/1600/IMG_0583.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/320/IMG_0583.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/1600/IMG_05711.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/320/IMG_05711.JPG" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sitting in a Starbucks paying 8€ an hour because Alex and I thought we could get free wireless here.

And now I can post pictures because they're on my computer, while normally I would be in an internet cafe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search for an apartment is only going ok...Alex is having better luck with getting appointments.  But it's only the second day we've been searching.  I'll just keep pressing on, I suppose.  &lt;sigh&gt;  It still scares me though because I don't want to end up in some crappy neighborhood...maybe I'll just end up in an apartment by myself.

I'm on a German kezboard in an internet cafe, and well, I am trzing to maximiye mz time while Im here, rather than worrzing about punctuation and spelling and all that good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mz time in London went well, and seeing Ken and his friends and Chris was reallz great.  We went to a comedz club in Leicester Square, which was quite fun, and we got some pints to drink (This is England we're talking about).  We also went to a pub afterward, and I think the result of that night is prettz much a given of what happened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also went to see Ewan McGregor in Guys and Dolls in the West End, and all I can saz is that it was FABULOUS.  I love the music and of course Ewan being in it helped a lot.  The worst part was probablz the imitated New York accents, but what can zou do?  I thought it ironic that I went to London to see a musical about New York...go figure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I said, I'm in an internet cafe with Alex sitting here next to me.  She is updating her blog too but she seems to keep typing and then deleting everzthing.  But anzwaz, I showed up in Tegel and thank goodness that Zoey and Alex were there, otherwise I would've had a major panic attack (which I had onlz a few dazs ago anzwaz).  We took the bus to the Zoologischer Garten, where Alex and I picked up a (Mercedes) cab and got to our B&amp;B, which is actuallz in a residence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex took a nap since she's been awake for a few hours (let's saz, 28 hours??), and then we left to walk around.  Funniest thing ever:  We walk outside and there, very close to where we are staying, was a car.  And not just anz car.  But this car had a MIDDLEBURY STICKER ON IT.  I know it's rude to type in all caps, but honestlz, what are the chances that we're here in Berlin, and a car has a Midd sticker on it?  I had to take a picture of it, and I promise I will post it when I get on mz own computer and all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how am I feeling through this whole experience thus far?  A few words:  Apprehensive.  Scared.  Nervous.  Doubtful.  And yes, mazbe even a little excited...but honestlz I think mz apprehension is overshadowing all other emotions.  I also feel like nobodz will understand me when I trz speaking in German because mz American accent is so thick, but granted that I will be here for a zear, mz German SHOULD be getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and first impressions of Berlin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The weather is worse than London.  Whz?  Well, I show up in London expecting prettz bad weather, but it was prettz decent.  I show up here and its cold and raining, which causes everzthing to be this graz color.  Mazbe it has something to do with how I feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II.  There are ridiculous amounts of H&amp;Ms.  Alex and I saw what...4 in a row?  We were thinking that thez were possiblz the same building, but no, thez weren't.  Thez were seperate H&amp;Ms on perhaps 2 blocks.  What the heck do zou need all the H&amp;Ms for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c.  It seems like everzone loves their pizza.  Alex and I have found numerous pizzerias.  We haven't eaten any....yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four.  Considering that I've onlz been here for 8 hours, I don't think I can actuallz have a fourth observation.  Especiallz because we haven't reallz walked around that much...we went through a bunch of residential neighborhoods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, but I do have to say, it will take me awhile to get used to people being able to smoke just about everywhere.  So just as a warning to any family members reading this:  I'm probablz going to come home smelling like cigarettes, the way Tzeh did when she came home from Florence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for now...I guess I'll be ok.  I'm hoping to buy a cell phone within the next two days (I'm going to ask Zoey for help), and hopefullz I will find an apartment within the next 6.  I'm not forcing mzself to find anzthing in this time period, because I realiye that will just make things harder.  All I reallz need is a good location, internet, a kitchen, and a bed.  Not too difficult, I don't think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess that's it for this edition of mz adventures in Berlin.  Perhaps the next time I write I will have mz own place bz then..........</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.sannielee.com/feeds/112801638401183817/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=11366735&amp;postID=112801638401183817&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112801638401183817'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112801638401183817'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/09/new-beginnings.html' title='New Beginnings'/><author><name>plee</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/09357319679260809789</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='21' height='32' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/-B_ncCNoBwwM/VEV3Kf3rxkI/AAAAAAAABO4/GhJ8pSOygZw/s32/*'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112606339389679881</id><published>2005-09-07T05:19:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2005-09-07T05:23:13.896+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>New York, New York</title><content type='html'>Over the weekend I went to see Back to the Future with my sister Tracie and her fiancé Wayne in a theater on the lower East Side.

It gets dark early and stays cool for most of the morning. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;My big sis and her man left today for massahossetts and I'm here contemplating heading into the city to get my fro trimmed. Sometimes I feel very alone myself, eventhough I have your beuatiful sister to come home to and hang out with. Cities have a way of making you feel lost in the crowd.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Sometimes it is nice to be able to retreat to that and sometimes its nice to get away.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Your language mastery will increase and you'll probably lose your 'merican accent to a large degree. Don't worry too much about whether or not people understand you and don't let it frustrate you too much. People spend years in their own countries being misunderstood on a regular basis (take that idiot that call himself our president for example).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Anyways, start taking pictures and posting them on that fancy flickr account I gave you (you can integrate your flickr and your blog very easily - check it out) once you get your own place, and we'll be reading here as often as we can.

Keep the pictures coming they really brighten up the experience of a blog.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/112915165013079278/comments/default/112922125156011261'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/112915165013079278/comments/default/112922125156011261'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/10/berlin-photos.html?showComment=1129221240000#c112922125156011261' title=''/><author><name>Sharo.</name><uri>http://www.patriciarocks.com</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='//img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://www.sannielee.com/2005/10/berlin-photos.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112915165013079278' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/112915165013079278' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1466998134'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='6:34 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-112923773833520885</id><published>2005-10-13T23:08:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2005-10-13T23:08:58.336+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>i really don't know how i came to read your blog, ...</title><content type='html'>i really don't know how i came to read your blog, but i think that it has got something to do with browsing through nerf herder related sites... :) &lt;BR/&gt;keep writing, i really am interested about what your stay here in germany (jawohl, ich bin deutscher :) ) will be like and what you think about it.

So much for being environmentally friendly. (Yes, i should just bring an extra canvas bag. hence wanting your german canvas bag.)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I'm glad that you settled in.

I can't post much because of this old computer and not having the right port to connect to my video camera.  And getting the right adaptor would be an ordeal.  The xmas decorations in Logrono are pretty tight too.  They have lights strung up across the streets about every five feet, and this strange blue christmas tree in the middle of the down town, which is probably blue because it's sponsored by some company called Azul, which also sponsored the ice rink they've put outside the catedral.  It almost reminds me of Midd, the way they just froze water over the plaza and voila, rink!  Except this is a little less ghetto as they've put up a tent over it and people actually use ice skates and there's nary a broom in sight.

We answered her, and she was like "Wow. You guys are so lucky to be able to go to Europe. I've wanted to go my whole life."

I had assumed to see a lot of faceless concrete buildings, and time worn faces on the local population. That couldn't have been farther from the truth. Prague is at a crossroads between old and new, constraint and freedom. It has an incredible history of conquest, peace, and domination. The Czech Republic has seen many changes in the last few decades and it is nice to see that Prague hasn't lost any of its &lt;A HREF="http://www.czech.cz/en/culture/most-beautiful-sights-and-places-of-interest/" REL="nofollow"&gt;charm&lt;/A&gt;. This was my first trip to this &lt;A HREF="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A190018" REL="nofollow"&gt;capital city&lt;/A&gt;. I was able to see really interesting architecture, listen to very talented musicians and see works of art in many different forms. If you haven't been to Prague yet it should be on your list for places to visit in Europe. It's also popular in Europe as a cheap place to go, book &lt;A HREF="http://www.prague-hotels.org.uk/" REL="nofollow"&gt;hotels in Prague&lt;/A&gt; and get drunk, especially for stag nights and the like! Though I didn't have the opportunity to visit many places that surround Prague, there was enough to find to do in the city itself for the 4 days that I was there.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/114158116633409302/comments/default/7856736260821977610'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/114158116633409302/comments/default/7856736260821977610'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/03/karneval-prague.html?showComment=1208871240000#c7856736260821977610' title=''/><author><name>Russel</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/17625242814447234079</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='//img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://www.sannielee.com/2006/03/karneval-prague.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-114158116633409302' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/114158116633409302' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1025028049'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='3:34 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-5609560176143863525</id><published>2008-06-23T00:11:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2008-06-23T00:11:35.541+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Hi everyone, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This article is very interest...</title><content type='html'>Hi everyone, &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;This article is very interesting.&lt;BR/&gt;You can find the whole list of international Burger King fast-foods restaurants at &lt;A HREF="http://www.fast-foods-restaurants.com/" REL="nofollow"&gt;http://www.fast-foods-restaurants.com/&lt;/A&gt;

I replied, in 'englisch', "the story was a bit too mushy for me."  Can't say I'd seen the teacher blush before, but she sure did then.  Had the whole class laughing.  I, of course, hadn't the foggiest, and repeated it when she re-asked.

I am also used to being the minority; I lived in Arkansas for six years. I remembered not being included in neither the "White" nor the "Black" students activities. I was always the outsider.

In addition to the normal college stuff, there's some town group called "Better Middlebury Partnership" that sponsored a bunch of events, from dog sled demos to a bonfire at night.  The best was definitely the chili contest, where pros and amateurs lined the streets with different kinds of chili to sample.  There were 34 tables total, each averaging 2+ kinds of chili.  Trevor and I made it down one side of the street, then stopped at 2 bros for a beer, and then made our way back but were too full to taste everthing.  And, I was actually up at the bowl for the races this year bc I was teaching, and they were giving out free maple cotton candy and maple ice.  It was pretty sweet.  Nothing as cool as dressing up for Fasching, but I've never seen so many people in the streets of Middlebury at one time before.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/4022129602748360311/comments/default/6821567261055255018'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/4022129602748360311/comments/default/6821567261055255018'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/02/karneval-round-3.html?showComment=1235420700000#c6821567261055255018' title=''/><author><name>Elise</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/11665421896340330392</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='//img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/02/karneval-round-3.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-4022129602748360311' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/4022129602748360311' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1451275871'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='9:25 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-2595949523765234542</id><published>2009-02-25T16:11:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2009-02-25T16:11:16.510+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>I guess human nature is when you do the same thing...</title><content type='html'>I guess human nature is when you do the same thing over and over you get tired of it.

There is a saying in Hong Kong "You respect the clothes before you respect the person!" You definitely get judge by how well you dress in HK; it is a status symbol to dress well in HK. I remembered when I was a child there; I went to a resturant by the harbor to have lunch with my mother's friends, they both were doctors. I gotten cold stare by the girls that was pushing the dim-sum cart. Her look was saying "Looked at the way you dress you don't belong here; so I don't have to give you any service!" &lt;br /&gt;I am glad you like HK. Also you were there when the weather was nice. If you were there in the summer then you might not like it as much. It can get very hot and humid. Maybe someday we can go there together; I have not be back there since I left years ago.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/395794320876981536/comments/default/1563979721805185212'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/395794320876981536/comments/default/1563979721805185212'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/04/asia-trip-week-2-hong-kong-china.html?showComment=1239808500000#c1563979721805185212' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='//img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/04/asia-trip-week-2-hong-kong-china.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-395794320876981536' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/395794320876981536' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-415975486'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='5:15 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-3945979562588969063</id><published>2009-07-31T21:29:52.106+02:00</published><updated>2009-07-31T21:29:52.106+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Your hair is so long!!

I would have picked the Foo Fighters latest album, &amp;quot;Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp;amp; Grace&amp;quot; because I felt it combined the soft and hard stuff so well into one album instead of splitting them apart in a double album.  Double albums are just too long for me I guess.  Plus I like the songs better.  Anyway, the better they get, the more reasons I have to hate Dave Grohl. I&amp;#39;ve written 21 reasons why I hate him on my website.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/7681034553252691125/comments/default/1753689234972035036'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/7681034553252691125/comments/default/1753689234972035036'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/12/reflections-on-decade-2000s.html?showComment=1260637098456#c1753689234972035036' title=''/><author><name>Jason</name><uri>http://www.ihatedavegrohl.com/post/278425749/21-reasons-why-i-hate-dave-grohl</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='//img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://www.sannielee.com/2009/12/reflections-on-decade-2000s.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-7681034553252691125' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/7681034553252691125' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-652598249'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='5:58 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-5916711338261805112</id><published>2009-12-30T23:08:54.270+01:00</published><updated>2009-12-30T23:08:54.270+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>15 is no excuse for N-Sync...

But I can spend hours browsing in the soft quiet, murmuring voices and the smell of the books.  I still read books, have stacks by my bedside and belong to a book club where we read &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love my Kindle.  Even though the new Fire was out, I chose the pushbutton one.  I&amp;#39;ve purchased a highly recommended book for 99 cents that was great, and a couple for $10.  I love how easy it is for transporting.  For travel is is perfect.  How many plane flights have I tried to stuff 3 books in my bag? !!  Also, I do believe you can share books between other Kindle users.  But don&amp;#39;t quote me!  I enjoy your blogs!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/8522074093196774859/comments/default/7037464631270872909'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/8522074093196774859/comments/default/7037464631270872909'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.sannielee.com/2011/10/why-i-have-yet-to-switch-to-e-books.html?showComment=1326816141432#c7037464631270872909' title=''/><author><name>Judy</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='//img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://www.sannielee.com/2011/10/why-i-have-yet-to-switch-to-e-books.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-8522074093196774859' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/11366735/posts/default/8522074093196774859' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1518873533'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='5:02 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-11366735.post-2690347840515955085</id><published>2012-01-20T06:00:41.835+01:00</published><updated>2012-01-20T06:00:41.835+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Hello there!
