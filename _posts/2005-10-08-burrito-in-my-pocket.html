No, this post has nothing to do with burritos in my pocket, although Alex and I did have a discussion about that. (I did do that while I was at Middlebury though, last semester.) We had lunch at a Mexican place in Prenzlauerberg, which was surprisingly good. I didn't think I would find any Mexican restaurants on this side of the pond, but, well, we did.<br /><br />Most importantly to post on here is that I have <em>FINALLY</em> found an apartment. After emailing nearly 90 people and making at least 30 calls (no exaggeration), I have found a place in Kreuzberg, which is similar to the Lower East Side in New York City.  I will be living with two German guys, Christian and Pablo.  Yes, Pablo.  Alex and I have discussed what cracked out German would give their son a Spanish name, but I will probably figure that out in the not-so-distant-future.  I won't be able to move in until November 1 because Heike, whose room I will be occupying, is not leaving until then.  I believe she is going abroad and will be back in May, when I will have to move out.<br /><br />I'm not too concerned about having to move out because I've got it all figured out.  I can live on my own for the last two or three months while I am here in Berlin.  It won't be too long nor will it be too short, and people can't say, "Well, you should try living with people."  Of course, plans can change, but for now, I'm not thinking about that.  I think I will have to worry more about the fact that I am starting classes in 10 days and will be living in a hotel for the first three weeks.<br /><br />On the note of living in a hotel, I think that it will probably delay the culture shock which is sure to come.  I feel like a tourist rather than a student, and people still talk to me in English rather than German.  It's a bit frustrating, mostly because I feel like my vocabulary is slowly dwindling, even though I am here in Germany.  However, once classes start, German will be in full force and I will probably talk mostly in it.<br /><br />So besides de-stressing because I have found a place to live, Alex and I went to Checkpoint Charlie and the East Side Gallery today.  It was bizarre seeing Checkpoint Charlie swarming with happy tourists, but I suppose it can be seen as two different symbols: a symbol of freedom and a symbol of division.  I guess when I think "Checkpoint Charlie" I think symbol of division, so I didn't take any pictures with Alex or me in them.  On the other hand, I took a ton of pictures over at the East Side Gallery, which is basically this long stretch of the Berlin Wall which has been left with lots of street art on it.  It was very powerful seeing some of the artwork and I think much more interesting than Checkpoint Charlie.  (Not to mention we didn't have to pay to get into a museum or anything, plus it was a gorgeous day outside.)<br /><br />If you want to read something more eloquent on what we saw today, I suggest reading <a href="http://alexberlinfall05.blogspot.com/">Alex's blog</a>.  She's a more eloquent writer than I am.<br /><br />So things I have accomplished so far in Berlin:<br /><br />1.  Finding an apartment, after seeing about 12 and having more than 90 emails sent out.<br />II.  Went to the Brandenburg Gate on the Tag der Einheit Deutschlands, having wurst, and drinking beer.  (And no, I have not gotten drunk.  Just red.)<br />c.  Discovered the joy of d√∂ner kebabs.  And Alex has made many a joke on that.<br />Four.  Begun to master the public transportation system of the U- and S-bahns.<br />Fifth.  Been in an internet cafe more than I would like to admit.<br /><br />And on that note...I guess I should end it here.  But yeah, I am not moving into my apartment until November 1, so I can't receive any regular mail until then.
