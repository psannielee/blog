But no, you have to put in a credit card number...but we figured, eh, we trekked here with our computers, might as well just do it.  And now I can post pictures because they're on my computer, while normally I would be in an internet cafe.<br /><br />The search for an apartment is only going ok...Alex is having better luck with getting appointments.  But it's only the second day we've been searching.  I'll just keep pressing on, I suppose.  <sigh>  It still scares me though because I don't want to end up in some crappy neighborhood...maybe I'll just end up in an apartment by myself.  We'll see.<br /><br />Im posting pictures from the past few days, including the car with the Middlebury sticker on it.
