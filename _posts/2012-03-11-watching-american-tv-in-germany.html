A few weeks ago, <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank">The Oatmeal</a> posted <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones" target="_blank">a comic</a> about streaming Game of Thrones (due to copyright, I can't actually post it on my blog, so go look at it before you read the rest of this).&nbsp; The essence of the comic is that there is a dilemma to watching shows legally: watch it on Netflix or download it on iTunes, purchase it through Amazon, stream it on Hulu or the HBO site, or just download it illegally.&nbsp; The dilemma is when the show is unavailable on legal sources like Netflix, iTunes, Amazon, and Hulu, and HBO wants you to have a whole subscription in order to watch it.&nbsp; At that point, you can either wait until Hulu/Netflix/other services has it, or you can download it.<br /><br />Living outside the United States poses a similar problem.&nbsp; I myself prefer to choose legal means to consume media and pay for everything because I think that the people involved with the media production deserve to get the money (though yes, I do realize that they only get pennies and it's the executives and other people not actually involved in production that get the biggest portion).&nbsp; However, it's problematic when shows are a season behind here in Germany because the shows need to be dubbed.<br /><br />And that's my biggest problem.&nbsp; I would love to have a service like Netflix here, but the majority of services don't offer the choice between watching something in the original version and the dubbed version.&nbsp; It's so stupid because it is so easy to have different files with different audio tracks -- look at DVDs!&nbsp; I also can't buy/rent/stream things through the American Amazon or iTunes because my IP address is obviously from Germany.&nbsp; I could pay for an American proxy server, sure, but I'm pretty sure there could be some legal hangups there just as much as downloading.&nbsp; So even if I want to watch something legally, I might have to watch it dubbed if I watch it online.&nbsp; Otherwise, I have to wait until the DVD comes out and that takes even longer than in the U.S.&nbsp; DVDs can come out possibly two seasons after it airs in the U.S.&nbsp; Can you imagine trying to not hear about how <i>Lost</i> ended while waiting for the DVDs?&nbsp; It was a near impossible task.<br /><br />Here in Germany, it's not even just limited to watching TV shows.&nbsp; I can't even watch videos on YouTube that have music in them, including official music videos from the artists.&nbsp; (Trying to find Lady Gaga's video "Marry the Night" in its entirety was annoying.)&nbsp; Thanks to GEMA, official music videos can't be streamed over YouTube because it would be too expensive to have to pay for every time the video is watched.&nbsp; Even for big acts like Lady Gaga.&nbsp; It just frustrates me that OFFICIAL VIDEOS are even blocked!&nbsp; It's not like it's some schmuck that uploaded a poor copy of the video.<br /><br />How is it that in this day and age of interconnectivity we are still unable to figure out connections like this?&nbsp; I guess part of it is the SOPA/PIPA/ACTA type bills that try to prosecute servers which have uploaded files.&nbsp; Watching the debates of the SOPA/PIPA bills was simultaneously amusing and sad because none of the sponsors seem to really have an idea how the internet works.&nbsp; But listening to them also just made me think that copyright laws are completely out of date.&nbsp; They don't take into account that the world is more connected and that technology is changing the way we consume media.&nbsp; Copyright laws had problems even back in the day of video tapes and cassettes and yet those are still the same laws with minimal change that are policy.&nbsp; I think copyright law should be scrapped and rewritten anew and take into consideration that interconnectivity is inevitable.&nbsp; Not only that, but companies are losing even more money because of these restrictions.&nbsp; I would like to believe that people other than myself would pay for available services to watch shows in broadcast quality.<br /><br />Surprisingly, two shows I watch regularly allow people abroad to watch them on their websites: <i><a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/" target="_blank">The Daily Show</a> </i>and <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/" target="_blank"><i>The Colbert Report</i></a>.&nbsp; I don't know what exactly their deal is and why they are accessible, but I watch both shows on the sites directly and even sit through the advertisements.&nbsp; Sometimes the ads are geared towards someone living in Germany, meaning, they're in German, but sometimes they're clearly ads for an American audience for products that don't exist here.&nbsp; But that's ok.&nbsp; Because they are available here NOT DUBBED or shortened or anything, I feel that my loyalty to the shows is even more so than with others who refuse access.&nbsp; So kudos to Comedy Central and Viacom for allowing fans outside North America to watch these shows.&nbsp; Everyone else should follow their example.
