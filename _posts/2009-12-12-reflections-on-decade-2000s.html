As a reminder that the decade is going to be over in less than 20 days, let's review what this decade was like.<br /><br />We started off with Y2K (hooray!  We all survived!  And the coming of Web 2.0 has made it possible for me to write this and share it with you!) and then there was the whole Napster shenanigans, two elections in the United States that left many people scratching their heads, 9/11, iPods and Apple took over the world, a lot of political stuff I don't really feel like getting into, the blur of the mid-2000s, and ok, let's bring it up to now: a black man was elected to the highest office in the United States, we have one of the biggest recessions in recent decades and global warming is on the rise.<br /><br />Hmm...it looks like this decade for me could be summed up into two categories: politics and technology.  I know I glossed over a LOT of stuff, but just pick up any news magazine and I'm sure it'll go into it for you.  Let's move on to the less serious stuff, shall we?<br /><br />I've picked out 20 albums of the 2000s that are significant for me for some reason or another.  Here they are with just a sentence or two about why they're on this list:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">20 Albums of the 2000s</span><br /><br />1.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">'N Sync - No Strings Attached</span> (2000) - I was 15.  End of story.<br /><br />2.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Living End - Roll On (2000)</span> - My penpal introduced me to The Living End with this album.  I just loved the mix of rockabilly and punk music together and have been a fan ever since.<br /><br />3.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Hives - Veni Vidi Vicious</span> (2000) - For me, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCQ7VLoY7bQ">"Hate to Say I Told You So"</a> was really catchy and the album was a return of rock the way it should be: loud, fuzzy guitars that are fun to dance to.  Not only that, I was impressed with the matching suits.<br /><br />4.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Weezer - The Green Album</span> (2001) - It took Weezer long enough to put out an album after 1996's <span style="font-style: italic;">Pinkerton</span>.  I liked this album when it came out; I'll admit it.  A bit pop-y in comparison to <span style="font-style: italic;">Pinkerton</span>, but hey, Weezer was back!<br /><br />5.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flogging Molly - Drunken Lullabies </span>(2002) - By far, Flogging Molly's best album.  I think I had gone to the Vans Warped Tour in 2002 and they played stuff off <span style="font-style: italic;">Drunken Lullabies</span>.  It was perfect for that and it still hasn't lost its charm.<br /><br />6.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Donnas - Spend the Night</span> (2002) - Three words: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mPKC6UDiks">"Take It Off."</a>  Not to mention this was The Donnas' breakout album, but it was really fantastic seeing a girl punk band I could see myself relating to if I hadn't been a teenager (aka awkward).<br /><br />7.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK Go - OK Go</span> (2002) - OK Go's debut album.  Most people would pick their album <span style="font-style: italic;">Oh No </span>since they made it big with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJulhGUh8vU">"Here it Goes Again,"</a> but I discovered OK Go with their self-titled and no, I'm not just saying that, I really did.  I immediately fell in love with the album because it was fun, catchy, danceable, and smart.<br /><br />8.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kylie Minogue - Fever</span> (2002) - There are so many good songs on this album: "Come into my World," "In Your Eyes," "Love at First Sight," and of course, "Can't Get You Outta My Head."<br /><br />9.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The White Stripes - White Blood Cells</span> (2002) - I just remember seeing the video for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q27BfBkRHbs">"Fell in Love with a Girl"</a> and thinking it was the coolest video in a long time.  This reconfirmed my belief that loud, fuzzy guitars were back (see above, #3, The Hives' <span style="font-style: italic;">Veni Vidi Vicious</span>).<br /><br />10.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Queens of the Stone Age - Songs for the Deaf</span> (2002) - Dave Grohl was the guest drummer on this album, I think.  I loved the bass line for "No One Knows."  Also the video for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBwWUfLlglw">"Go with the Flow"</a> was pretty awesome.<br /><br />11.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Outkast - Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</span> (2003) - Two albums at once?!  Why not.  There were 3 songs in particular that will never, ever get old, even 6 years later: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zvkV8e_rdU">"Hey Ya!,"</a> "The Way You Move," and "Roses."<br /><br />12.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ratatat - Ratatat</span> (2003) - I saw Ratatat perform on Middlebury's campus.  They played this album in its entirety in about an hour.  And they played it again.  And again.  Mostly because everyone was so into it.  It was a ton of fun and the best thing...it was free!  (And before everyone on campus started listening to it so the show wasn't overrun.)<br /><br />13.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Green Day - American Idiot</span> (2004) - Ok, so their album <span style="font-style: italic;">Warning</span> came out in 2000 and I had liked it.  It was different.  But <span style="font-style: italic;">American Idiot</span> was just a completely new level.  Who else could've pulled off a punk rock opera other than Green Day?  And that is exactly why this album is on this list.<br /><br />14.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Franz Ferdinand - Franz Ferdinand </span>(2004) - Fun, danceable, catchy rock.  And if music could be described as "sexy," yes, this album is definitely sexy.  This album still hasn't gotten old and I remember comparing it to The Strokes' <span style="font-style: italic;">Room on Fire</span>.  To say the least, <span style="font-style: italic;">Franz Ferdinand</span> is such a better album and they're such a better band.  Hence why I still like them.<br /><br />15.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kelly Clarkson - Breakaway</span> (2004) - Kelly Clarkson is probably my guilty pleasure of the decade and this album had a lot of really good songs on it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMMvEIjr3CI"> "Since U Been Gone"</a> is probably my favorite.<br /><br />16.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Foo Fighters - In Your Honor</span> (2005) - Admittedly I couldn't decide which FF album from this decade should go on here, especially considering that their best is still <span style="font-style: italic;">The Colour and the Shape</span> (which came out in '97).  So I just arbitrarily picked <span style="font-style: italic;">In Your Honor</span> because it's got two CDs, the slow stuff and the fast stuff.  However, FF have put out some really great music in the last 10 years.<br /><br />17.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wir Sind Helden - Von hier an blind</span> (2005) - This was the first German album I purchased living in Germany.  Alex and I first heard <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-FaSIPszsY">"Nur ein Wort"</a> in a Berlin Dunkin' Donuts in Zoologischer Garten and we turned to each other, agreeing simultaneously that the song was super catchy.  It defined my year abroad.<br /><br />18.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Killers - Sam's Town</span> (2006) - In comparison to their debut album <span style="font-style: italic;">Hot Fuss</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sam's Town</span> is just a fantastic record because it works as an idea.  I'm not even sure it was a concept album, but that's what I got from it.  It's a lot tighter than their first release and they really seemed to fine-tune their presence with it.<br /><br />19.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Justin Timberlake - FutureSex/LoveSounds</span> (2006) - Another fantastic pop album.  I don't even really know what to say, except I find myself listening to this every once in awhile.<br /><br />20.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radiohead - In Rainbows</span> (2007) - This isn't on here for its content; rather, <span style="font-style: italic;">In Rainbows </span>is significant because it was the first album to be released on the internet by the band themselves and then people were allowed to choose how much they wanted to pay for it.  Even nothing.  Good job Radiohead for trying to change the digital music industry.<br /><br />It seems like after 2007, there wasn't anything significant on my list.  That's not true; there are some bands I would've liked to put on, but hey, I needed to keep this list short.  On the other hand, everything released after 2007 that would be on this list are just other albums from artists already on here.<br /><br />As for movies, I can't really make a list because I don't own a lot movies from the last few years and it's not as easy to look at as my music in iTunes.  (Yay sorting by year.)  However, I think for me the most significant movie(s) this decade has to be <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</span>.  I don't think I've met anyone that hasn't seen these movies. <br /><br />On a more personal note, this decade is probably the first that I can remember in its entirety.  I remember exactly where I was and whom I was with when I rang in the new millenium.  This decade, I got both my high school and bachelor degrees, started working on my master's, and have lived in Germany for a total of three years.  In essence, I've become what some may consider an adult, which is a bit strange to think about. <br /><br />Who knows what will happen in the next decade, but I do have my guesses....Let's get ready for the 10s!!!  (teens?  tens?  How will we even say them?)
