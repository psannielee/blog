I do realize that it's been forever since I last wrote an entry, but after entering the 9-5 world of having a job, life abroad tends to be a little less exciting.  Working at Clipfish has been a lot of fun and I've been learning about internet media.  I've decided that it's not exactly where I want to go in life...I'll leave that to other people.  My coworkers are all very friendly and we can all have a good laugh together, but because I generally tend to avoid Köln (aka my apartment) on the weekend, I don't go out with the other interns nearly as much as I would like to.<br /><br />On the other hand, I have spent pretty much every weekend in Düsseldorf with Christian and his friends.  David (friend and fellow participant in my program) moved to Düsseldorf in March or so, so I see him on the weekend occasionally as well.  The weather last week was amazing: sunny, warm (70 degrees Fahrenheit, 22 degrees Celsius) and summery.  The sun goes down now quite late at around 9-9:30.  Last Friday was Christian's birthday and we spent 8 hours outside with his friends. <br /><br />Other developments that have happened since my last entry is that I'm officially moving to Germany after my program is done.  I managed to secure another internship in Düsseldorf at a small editing house called <a href="http://www.pirates-www.de/flash_content/pirates.html">Pirates n Paradise</a>.  They edit commericals for TV for products like Schwarzkopf, Chio Chips, Cab Beer (actually any kind of beer that is with the Krombacher group), etc.  There might be a job at the end of the internship which would be pretty sweet, but I'm not banking on it.  I'm just sort of using it as a way to get a visa in order to stay and keep searching for a job I want.  I have decided, however, that after this internship, I can't do any more, otherwise, I will be stuck doing internships for the rest of my life.  I need money!  The good thing about them being in Düsseldorf is that it means I can move in with Christian.  I'm definitely looking forward to that instead of having to take the regional train every weekend.<br /><br />I've also finally started up my website/guide to living abroad in Germany.  If you want to check it out, you can see it <a href="http://www.livebreatheabroad.com/germany/">here</a>.  I had written way more articles for it, but unfortunately, my computer broke last week.  I'm not sure what's wrong with it except that the screen won't come on and it doesn't work when I hook it up to an external monitor.  Bleh.  I wrote a few articles and saved them on there but didn't post them, so they'll have to wait.  Feedback would be greatly appreciated...just remember that it's very barebones and I still need to add links and photos.  I think I'll probably get a lot of work done on it when I'm at home for a month before I come back here.  I'm currently using Christian's laptop since he just bought a new desktop.  It isn't worth it really to pay to get<br /><br />Other than that, not much else has been happening.  I already have tickets to go see Indiana Jones 4 on Wednesday evening, so for all you guys in the U.S. : HA!  I get to see it before you.  (And of course in English)  Hopefully it'll be good.  Saturday I'm leaving for Berlin because we have our closing seminar and I'll be there for a week.  Then 4 weeks left working at Clipfish, Ba comes to visit at the end of June, two weeks in July free (one of those weeks will be spent in Berlin with Ba), and then I'm back in the States.  Time flies.
