Today was the orientation for students going through the Middlebury program.  We essentially sat around for a long time reviewing what we had already read through in the handbook (the only difference was that it was in German) and eating in this Italian restaurant in the Student Center.  (Or something.)  I can't say it was honestly helpful because I felt as if I missed a lot of what was said, orelse I already knew what was being said because of the handbook.  So either way, I still feel quite confused about the whole process of finding classes.  To be perfectly honest, and I never thought I would ever say this in my life, I think I miss Bannerweb.  For those of you who do not know what Bannerweb is, it's what we use at Midd to register for classes online which frequently has crashing problems as you register.  Bannerweb is easy, though it may kick you of the system at a crucial time or the like, and it is straightforward.  I'm not so sure about having this process of "shopping for classes."<br /><br />I don't think I was the only one to feel confused, as we all looked at each other and asked, "Did you get that?" or "Wait, is this what was meant?"  To sum it up using Zoey's quote:<br /><br />"I am <em>SO</em> over this Deutsch bullshit."<br /><br />Which is funny, especially because I am going to be here for a whole year.  In the end, putting it into perspective makes the year not seem TOO bad.  I will be confused, scared, and intimidated throughout first semester and second semester I will hopefully be confident and comfortable.<br /><br />The university is HUGE, especially in comparison to Middlebury.  I feel like I will get lost every day, and there is this whole system of finding rooms which confused me even further.  (Apparently there are addresses within the buildings...sort of.)  The buildings are pretty ugly, especially when you look at the cute little quaint buildings of that School on the Hill.  Founded in 1948, the Freie Universität looks like something out of the 1960s with bright colors popping out everywhere.  For those of you from home, I think it is way uglier than Fair Lawn High School's B-wing.  (Didn't think possible, but it seems the possibilities here are endless.)  I found it humorous that there was a JFK Building, as well as a Henry Ford Building.<br /><br />On the up note, we got a catalog of "Hochschulsport," which is essentially just a bunch of workshops and classes that are for sports.  I think I really want to do a swing class (as in, swing dance, not playing swing) or perhaps a salsa class.  I already took ballroom dancing during J Term with Dan, but I think taking it in another language will be ridiculously embarassing (and thus make for good stories) and at the same time, loads of fun.  They also have a gymnastics class which I am very tempted to take, but considering I haven't done any gymnastics since oh, junior year of high school, I probably shouldn't.  (And even then nobody could spot me because I was too big.)<br /><br />So in retrospect of today, I think it was a good day.  Alex and I will have eaten 3 meals by the end of the day and this is awesome because we've been cutting meals out to save money.  And Middlebury is paying us to eat out.  Always good.  Thanks, Middlebury.  I got the course catalog on CD from Katharina, one of the assistants, so Alex and I will have a good look at that.  Hopefully I will not be class-less by the time we actually have to choose classes.  And seeing the university...well...yes, I am intimidated, scared, and nervous, and it feels worse than being a freshman all over again at Middlebury, but it will be a life experience I can put under my belt and say, "Yes, I actually accomplished something in my life." <br /><br />Put simply, I am still taking one day at a time.
