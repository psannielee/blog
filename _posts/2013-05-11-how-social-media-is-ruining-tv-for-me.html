I don't consider myself a big TV person, but I am a loyal fan of two current shows: <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> and <i>Mad Men</i>.&nbsp; I keep up-to-date with them, as well, meaning, I am on the current season for both shows.&nbsp; Thank God for the internet.<br /><br />But seriously, even though the internet allows me to watch these shows, I can't watch them on Monday (for <i>HIMYM</i>) or Sunday (for <i>Mad Men</i>).&nbsp; In order to avoid finding out anything that happened, I practically have to avoid all social media the day after new episodes air.&nbsp; I have too many friends that watch them and will write something about it.&nbsp; Twitter is the worst, especially when it comes to <i>Mad Men</i>.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the <i>Mad Men</i>/AMC social media team and think they are doing a fantastic job of hyping and getting the show discussed.&nbsp; But I know that tomorrow morning, about 3/4 of my Twitter feed will be filled with reactions to <i>Mad Men</i> that the show retweeted.&nbsp; A good example is when the current sixth season started -- I knew before I watched the episode that (SPOILER ALERT!) Don was back to his womanizing ways and sleeping with his neighbor.&nbsp; As a result, the suspense from the fifth season's cliffhanger was sort of anticlimactic.&nbsp; Of course, I still watched the episode, but my reaction was sort of, "OK, I know that already."&nbsp; Here's some examples of what I don't really want to see at all, even though I would click on it after watching the episode (this past week was surprisingly not too bad):<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ckwkAwpncGA/UY5FoVIbZ3I/AAAAAAAAAwg/FhNUroAE8g4/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-07+at+9.24.24+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ckwkAwpncGA/UY5FoVIbZ3I/AAAAAAAAAwg/FhNUroAE8g4/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-07+at+9.24.24+PM.png" height="251" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V6pynk3hamA/UY5FsBcXoLI/AAAAAAAAAwo/J-aiEF4tCb0/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-07+at+9.26.11+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V6pynk3hamA/UY5FsBcXoLI/AAAAAAAAAwo/J-aiEF4tCb0/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-07+at+9.26.11+PM.png" height="108" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The funny thing is that after I started writing this blog post, the <a href="http://www.avclub.com/" target="_blank">AV Club</a> tweeted about an <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/theres-a-new-app-that-prevents-you-from-having-tv,97499/?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=standard-post:headline:default" target="_blank">add-on</a> which essentially makes social media ruining your TV viewing habits your own fault.&nbsp; It was as if they read my mind or something:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0S-MzOQ1MZw/UY5GH66ccXI/AAAAAAAAAww/WovhLMXK9Vo/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-08+at+10.20.55+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0S-MzOQ1MZw/UY5GH66ccXI/AAAAAAAAAww/WovhLMXK9Vo/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-08+at+10.20.55+PM.png" height="93" width="320" /></a></div><br />I guess I'll have to try it, but I wonder if it would block everything related to the shows I watch?&nbsp; Because I like reading about the non-spoiler stuff, like production or what have you.&nbsp; I'll give the add-on a whirl and see if I like it.<br /><br />On a related social media note, is Facebook asking anyone else for more information?&nbsp; I constantly get this screen when I log in:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vSc2A6TX2t0/UY5Dl5pXa2I/AAAAAAAAAwU/zoNFiXQqcbU/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-10+at+10.20.04+AM.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vSc2A6TX2t0/UY5Dl5pXa2I/AAAAAAAAAwU/zoNFiXQqcbU/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-05-10+at+10.20.04+AM.jpg" height="191" width="320" /></a></div>It's great that Facebook is trying to get more information from me and I get it.&nbsp; Try to make the whole social media experience more personalized, "more social."&nbsp; But there's quite obviously a reason why I <i>haven't</i> shared 40% of my information nor updated anything relevant.&nbsp; So Facebook, please, stop asking me for this information.&nbsp; At least add an option to not see this screen again because it's just annoying.&nbsp; I also find it slightly irritating that I can't delete my college information.&nbsp; This isn't really relevant to have on my Facebook profile anymore; it was useful when Facebook was only open to college students.&nbsp; Has anyone else figured out how to get rid of that information?&nbsp; I've tried with absolutely no luck.<br /><br />And now I officially feel like I'm <i>really</i> going retro.
