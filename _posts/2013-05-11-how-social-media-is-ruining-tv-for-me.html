<p>I don't consider myself a big TV person, but I am a loyal fan of two current shows: <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> and <em>Mad Men</em>. I keep up-to-date with them, as well, meaning, I am on the current season for both shows. Thank God for the internet.
</p>
<p>But seriously, even though the internet allows me to watch these shows, I can't watch them on Monday (for <em>HIMYM</em>) or Sunday (for <em>Mad Men</em>). In order to avoid finding out anything that happened, I practically have to avoid all social media the day after new episodes air. I have too many friends that watch them and will write something about it. Twitter is the worst, especially when it comes to <em>Mad Men</em>. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the <em>Mad Men</em>/AMC social media team and think they are doing a fantastic job of hyping and getting the show discussed. But I know that tomorrow morning, about 3/4 of my Twitter feed will be filled with reactions to <em>Mad Men</em> that the show retweeted. A good example is when the current sixth season started -- I knew before I watched the episode that (SPOILER ALERT!) Don was back to his womanizing ways and sleeping with his neighbor. As a result, the suspense from the fifth season's cliffhanger was sort of anticlimactic. Of course, I still watched the episode, but my reaction was sort of, "OK, I know that already." Here's some examples of what I don't really want to see at all, even though I would click on it after watching the episode (this past week was surprisingly not too bad):

The funny thing is that after I started writing this blog post, the <a href="http://www.avclub.com/" target="_blank">AV Club</a> tweeted about an <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/theres-a-new-app-that-prevents-you-from-having-tv,97499/?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=standard-post:headline:default" target="_blank">add-on</a> which essentially makes social media ruining your TV viewing habits your own fault. It was as if they read my mind or something:

<p>
I guess I'll have to try it, but I wonder if it would block everything related to the shows I watch? Because I like reading about the non-spoiler stuff, like production or what have you. I'll give the add-on a whirl and see if I like it.
</p>
<p>
On a related social media note, is Facebook asking anyone else for more information? I constantly get this screen when I log in:
</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/screenshot_facebook.jpg" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
It's great that Facebook is trying to get more information from me and I get it. Try to make the whole social media experience more personalized, "more social." But there's quite obviously a reason why I <em>haven't</em> shared 40% of my information nor updated anything relevant. So Facebook, please, stop asking me for this information. At least add an option to not see this screen again because it's just annoying. I also find it slightly irritating that I can't delete my college information. This isn't really relevant to have on my Facebook profile anymore; it was useful when Facebook was only open to college students. Has anyone else figured out how to get rid of that information? I've tried with absolutely no luck.
</p>
<p>
And now I officially feel like I'm <em>really</em> going retro.
