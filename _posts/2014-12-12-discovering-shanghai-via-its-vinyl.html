Not only have I been <a href="http://sannielee.com/2014/12/figuring-out-chinese-e-commerce-websites.html">figuring out how to buy vinyl</a> on Taobao.com, I also decided that in a city as big as Shanghai, there had to be some interesting record shops I could discover. &nbsp;Again, the mentality is that maybe I can find interesting releases here easier than I could in Europe or North America. &nbsp;But actually going out and finding local record shops was also a good way to go exploring the city. &nbsp;I'm a huge proponent of public transportation, so this was also a great excuse to just ride around the metro. &nbsp;Shanghai is full of so many enormous malls and chain stores that seeking out some hole-in-the-wall, locally owned stores just really appealed to me.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Admittedly, I first started searching online, entering "Shanghai record shop" and "Shanghai vinyl store" into Google. &nbsp;I got a few articles, but most of them were from about two years ago or so. &nbsp;Realizing how quickly the city is changing, I didn't expect all of them to still be around since it seems like two years here is an eternity. &nbsp;Taking <a href="http://www.echinacities.com/Shanghai/city-guide/The-Shanghai-Music-Guide-Record-Stores-Equipment-Recording-Studios-Venues">this article</a> as my main point of reference along with <a href="http://matthayward.com/2013/01/01/buying-vinyl-records-in-shanghai.htm">this blog entry</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.discogs.com/groups/topic/359901">this discussion on discogs.com</a>,&nbsp;I mapped out six record shops I wanted to visit, all of which were on the Puxi side of the city. &nbsp;(As an aside, one of the reasons why I'm writing this is to have updated information about these places out there.)</div><div><br /></div><div>Based purely on location, I decided to first visit the so-called "lamp fixtures market store" because the nearest metro station is also on the 7 line, which is the closest line to where I live. &nbsp;I found the market and the place where the shop supposedly was, but it looked closed. &nbsp;Disappointed, I left and went to check out <a href="http://uptownchina.com/">Uptown Records</a>. &nbsp;Similarly, I found the building where it was, but it too was not open. &nbsp;I wasn't sure if it was right or not because the entrance is beneath a residence building and it looks like you'll get murdered (see third image below for reference). At that point, I wasn't about to trek out to the other stores only to end up feeling like I wasted a whole day in case they weren't open. &nbsp;This was last Tuesday afternoon, and Uptown Records supposedly opened at 2. &nbsp;I was there at around 2:30 in the afternoon, so I figured it must've just been a fluke. &nbsp;Dejected, I went home and left the other shops for another day.</div><div><br /></div><div>Determined to figure out if these two stores actually were still open, I searched the internet for contact information and wrote them in English and Google-translated Chinese. &nbsp;The lamp fixtures market one wrote back saying he was still open. &nbsp;I knew Uptown was still open because when I was there and trying to figure out if I was the right place, I asked an old lady outside the building if she knew the store. &nbsp;All I could understand was that the day I visited, either the store wasn't open or was opening later.</div><div><a name='more'></a></div><div><br />Having evidence that the lamp fixtures market store is actually still in business, I went again midday on a Wednesday (the day before yesterday). &nbsp;And bingo, the place is indeed still in operation and actually called Vinyl Villa. &nbsp;(Note to anyone who is actually looking to find these place, I've detailed how to find the shops that are still open at the bottom of this article.) &nbsp;It's definitely not a touristy part of town and it's not a place that you would normally stumble across walking around since it's on the second floor of an actual lamp fixture market. &nbsp;If you look at the image below, that's what the complex looks like where Vinyl Villa is housed. &nbsp;The store isn't huge, but there is a good selection of vinyl to look through -- classic rock, jazz, funk/soul, hip-hop, and a small selection of punk. &nbsp;It looked like everything is secondhand and a mixed bag of Japanese, British, and American releases. &nbsp;I mostly took a look through the rock section and found that there was a lot of Elton John, REO Speedwagon, Foreigner, and Journey. &nbsp;Even so, I was surprised to find copies of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Various+Artists/Happy+Meals,+Volume+1:+A+Smorgasbord+of+My+Favorite+Songs">Happy Meals Vol. 1</a> (a compilation with Nerf Herder on it which made me nostalgic for high school), Voodoo Glow Skulls' <i><a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/6ANmj9hLIEMzNeJGMXdLsW">The Band Geek Mafia</a></i>, and some <a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/7ddEExcNWHxN2fwS1kTwkk">Potshot</a> records.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

he told me he likes a lot of different genres but will never play punk or folk. &nbsp;While I was in the shop, I noticed he was taking pictures of the records and uploading them to his Taobao shop, which is probably how he gets the majority of his business. &nbsp;I wound up getting a Japanese copy of a Paul McCartney record as well as an American release of something from The Cars, both for 30 RMB each ($4.85/3.89€). &nbsp;As other websites commented, Frank speaks English fluently and he was so kind enough to tell me he would email me when the next shipment of records would arrive. &nbsp;I will obviously be going back.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also decided to try finding Uptown Records again since I knew it was also open. &nbsp;Going on a Friday afternoon, I sought out the random location, finding the little entrance with the sign pointing to the store (see image below) and feeling confident it would be open. &nbsp;I confirmed my initial guess where the entrance was since there was a sign noting that the owner would be back at 3:30 p.m. though it was already closer to 4 p.m. &nbsp;The entrance feels like it's the door to Narnia or something because it's in such a random place; but one thing to note is that there aren't any zoning laws in China separating commercial and residential areas, which is why an arrangement like this is possible. &nbsp;Figuring I didn't feel like coming back again to find it closed again, I decided to wait. &nbsp;Watching all the people go in to the entrance from the street (again, see this image below), I saw a girl about my age go in and not come back out. &nbsp;I thought she might be the person running the store and I was right.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pCnEjh-vkN4/VIsQlwhyl-I/AAAAAAAABZU/ROwO4rkcybI/s1600/former_movie_star.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto;

neighboring stores were all selling cellos, violins, and other classical music instruments. &nbsp;I figured that that probably didn't actually have what I was looking for. &nbsp;Even if only two out of the six shops I wanted to check out are open, I got to discover corners of the city that I would never otherwise visit. &nbsp;I also got to know the metro a little better, and that will always come in use. &nbsp;In the meantime, I'll continue visiting both Vinyl Villa and Uptown, and keep looking on Taobao.com for other records.</div><div><br /></div><div><hr /></div><div>Getting to <a href="http://weibo.com/u/3109826857">Vinyl Villa</a>&nbsp;(link is to their Weibo account, which is in Chinese)</div><div>Address:</div>58 Yejiazhai Road, 2F, near Changshou Road<br /><div>叶家宅路58事久市场二楼, 近长寿路</div><div><br /></div><div>Take the metro line 7 to Chang Shou Road (长寿路). &nbsp;Take exit 1 at the station if it's open (it wasn't when I was there), and just keep walking straight out of that exit along Changshou Road (长寿路). &nbsp;If not, take exit 7, cross the wide avenue in front of you, turn left, and keep walking straight along Changshou Road (长寿路). &nbsp;When you get to Yejiazhai Road (叶家宅路), turn right. &nbsp;You'll see the whole lights fixture market on the right side. &nbsp;There are multiple entrances. &nbsp;If you go into any of them, there will be a first row of stalls that's parallel to the street. &nbsp;When I looked, there only seemed to be one staircase here, so walk up the staircase. &nbsp;If you look at the image above, I think the staircase is roughly where the big 2 in black and yellow is. &nbsp;At the top of the staircase, you'll see a bunch of TVs and fridges for sale and Vinyl Villa is on the left. &nbsp;It's hard to miss. &nbsp;If it's not open, you'll know you've found it if the gate is down but you'll see some vinyl records hanging outside it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Getting to Uptown Records</div><div>Address:</div><div>115 Pingwu Road, basement, near Xingfu Road</div>平武路115号, 近幸福路<br /><div><br /></div><div>Take the metro line 11 or 10 to Jiaotong University (交通大学) and take exit 6. &nbsp;Turn left when you come out of the station and walk along Huashan Road (华山路). &nbsp;Take the first left after the park, which is Pingwu Road (平武路). &nbsp;Number 115 is actually a residential building, but there's a small entrance way next to where the residents go in with small sign letting you know you're in the right place (see image above). &nbsp;It might look completely wrong since there's a bunch of parking spaces and other stuff, but you're in the correct place. &nbsp;Walk down the ramp, hang a left, and then the door to Uptown Records is a red iron door next to a small staircase on your left. &nbsp;If you've walked to the end of the corridor, you've gone too far. &nbsp;If the store is open, the door is open and a light is on. &nbsp;If Uptown is closed, the light won't be on and you might not see the red door because it's kind of dark. &nbsp;See picture above for what the door looks like. &nbsp;Walk down the stairs to the bottom, go through the bunker-like door, and then the rooms with the records is on the left. &nbsp;You'll hear the music.</div>
