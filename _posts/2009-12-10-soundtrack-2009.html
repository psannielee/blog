As the end of the year draws near, a lot of reflection is usually done.  My sister Tracie wrote an entry on her blog of the same title and I thought it a good idea.  I haven't made a yearly soundtrack since I left college, but I got inspired from my sister's entry.  So here are some songs that represent 2009 for me:
<br />
<br />
1.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6b6yhsqps4">Franz Ferdinand "Ulysses"</a> - This song kept me going on the S-bahn platform at 6:30 in the morning quite often when it first came out.  I had been anticipating the release of their album "Tonight: Franz Ferdinand" and it didn't disappoint.  Not to mention that I won tickets for their show in November and I was so excited to hear this live.
<br />
<br />
2.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOavkUZbbyg">The Living End "Hey Hey Disbeliever"</a> - The Living End came on tour to Europe and their album <em>White Noise</em> was <strong>finally</strong> released over here (still hasn't been released in the U.S. to my knowledge).  Too bad I didn't see them on their second go around, but I gave up that opportunity to save money for Paul McCartney.  (More on that in a bit)  But The Living End was still amazing live, though I hadn't seen them in quite a bit.  This song just rocks.
<br />
<br />
3.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGR8gW66iqY">Green Day "Horseshoes and Handgrenades"</a> - I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that Green Day's audience gets younger and younger while I get older.  I was disappointed that they didn't play this song when I saw them, in addition to the fact that they didn't sing "Welcome to Paradise."  (C'mon, Green Day!)  I'm not sure I would say the album 21st Century Breakdown was a highlight of this year, though I had been excited for the album's release.  There was certainly better music released, but Green Day's music has developed into a style that's definitely better for arena shows.  And they definitely are a good arena show.
<br />
<br />
4.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MKz0gkcgAo">Katy Perry "Hot n Cold"</a> - Yup, a pop song.  This song for me was really infectious.  The link I put up is to a <em>Twilight</em> parody with "Hot n Cold" in it.  It's pretty hilarious.  I'm by no means a <em>Twilight</em> fan (actually, far from it.  I hate it), but somehow the song is super-fitting.  "Hot n Cold" was also everywhere here for awhile.
<br />
<br />
5.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLsQ_8PwwDs">Calexico "The Crystal Frontier (Widescreen Version)"</a> - Ok, this song is old.  And yes, I saw Calexico in October 2008.  Doesn't matter.  This song is just pure awesomeness and it was on my iPod on repeat.
<br />
<br />
Besides these five songs, this song was actually dominated by The Beatles.  Sure, their last recorded album, <em>Abbey Road</em>, was released 40 years ago, but this year was almost like 1995-1996 when the <em>Anthology</em> was released.  For one, the digital remasters were released.  Admittedly, I haven't heard them yet except for <em>Abbey Road</em> and <em>Let it Be</em> (which I bought separately since they were released only in stereo) because they're waiting for me at home in the U.S. unopened, so I can't tell you if they're good or not.  But there were so many reviews about them that it was as if new Beatles albums had been released.  According to some, these remastered CDs were like experiencing the albums for the first time.  <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em> was also released, but I haven't bought it nor played it out of fear that it will destroy my perception of the music.  Maybe we'll see about that in the future.
<br />
<br />
In addition to the remastered CDs' release, I went to <a href="http://sannielee.com/2009/09/18/liverpool-england-pilgrimage.html">Liverpool</a>, home of the Fab Four.  And finally, I'll be seeing Paul McCartney in a week in the KÃ¶ln Arena.  So besides the five songs above, I'd have to add these particular songs:
<br />
<br />
6.  The Beatles "Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End" - I think this medley is just amazing, especially because The Beatles knew that this was the last album they would record together.  It's a pretty good ending, isn't it?  (Ok, if you don't count "Her Majesty.")
<br />
<br />
7.  The Beatles "Maggie Mae" - Until I went to Liverpool, I didn't realize how this song is sung with their Scouser accent.  I think I have a better appreciation for it because of my trip.
<br />
<br />
8.  Paul McCartney "Only Mama Knows" - Because I'm seeing Paul next week, I bought his album <em">Memory Almost Full</em>.  When it first came out, I was originally against it because it was released through Starbucks, but after a first listen, I actually really liked it.  I'm pretty sure he'll be playing this song next week, so to say the least, I'm excited.
<br />
<br />
I cannot wait to hear the mono remastered CDs when I get home in a week and a half.
