Continuing what I mentioned in my previous post that it seems that Europeans were excited to fly back to the U.S., I have to say, I'm surprised at Obama's presence everywhere. While I was on the subway, a homeless (black) man got on and basically said this: "OBAMA!  I am a Vietnam Vet!  Hey, you're gorgeous!  OBAMA!  Can you spare some change?  Change, yeah, ha ha!  Obama!"  That's a new way of getting money, I suppose.  However, here are some visual examples that I found:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSx_TsLjYXI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/KDBeOiSVX4o/s1600-h/IMG_6985.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 141px; height: 188px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSx_TsLjYXI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/KDBeOiSVX4o/s200/IMG_6985.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272729239997866354" border="0" /></a>Tracie and I ate at this restaurant yesterday.  As you can see, there is an Obama '08 sign in the window.  I've noticed that many businesses actually have similar displays of support like this.  When I visited Tracie at her Brooklyn apartment on Saturday, many barber shops that I passed by proudly displayed their Obama signs.  There was one shop that had a poster that said "American Heroes" or something like that as a headline and then a picture of JFK and Martin Luther King, Jr. with Obama's picture bigger than either.  The comparison was clear.<br />Driving into Manhattan using the Holland Tunnel, there was an unmissable large Obama/Biden '08 billboard on Route 9.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSyAq424y9I/AAAAAAAAAHY/6pSAT38EmDo/s1600-h/IMG_6986.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 200px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSyAq424y9I/AAAAAAAAAHY/6pSAT38EmDo/s200/IMG_6986.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272730738049469394" border="0" /></a>I took this picture on Grant Street in SoHo.  Unfortunately, I didn't actually look at what they were selling, but I'm pretty sure it was t-shirts and stuff.  (Fashionable, of course)  You can sort of see some merchandise through the window where Obama's neck is.  Tracie told me that a store nearby had been selling mugs during the election season and keeping a tally of how many McCain/Palin and Obama/Biden mugs were sold.  She said the McCain/Palin ones totaled perhaps 10, while the Obama/Biden ones filled the window tally and actually extended elsewhere in the store.  I feel like Obama has become a recognizable icon whose face will appear on shirts like Che Guevara.  Political fashion icon?  Perhaps.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSyCnOMwM7I/AAAAAAAAAHg/OUw1tDi0deQ/s1600-h/IMG_6988.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_29FFLJkQ9Dw/SSyCnOMwM7I/AAAAAAAAAHg/OUw1tDi0deQ/s200/IMG_6988.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272732874082104242" border="0" /></a>I saw this children's book about Barack Obama at my local Barnes &amp; Noble while shopping with my dad.  All I could think was, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Seriously</span>?"  The title is <span style="font-style: italic;">Barack Obama, Son of Promise, Child of Hope</span> and the opening page basically told of his biracial heritage.  Now, I think it's great that the book wants to talk about biracial families, but a children's book about Barack Obama?  Don't get me wrong, I supported the senator, but I thought that this was a bit much.  Granted, I didn't read through the entire book, but I couldn't get past the fact that it's a biography for children.  The man hasn't even become president yet and still has a lot in front of him.  Yes, he has achieved a lot and yes, he is inspiring, but couldn't we wait for a book like that to come out?<br /><br />This brings me to something I discussed with my friend Zach, whose French roommate asked him if he thought it was strange that the US is the only country where people will wear clothing with their presidential pick on clothing.  It's a good point, but I think I've also become a little German in this sense.  I question whether or not it's a good thing that people are so zealous about a political figure.  Part of my questioning is also due to the fact that I'm reading <span style="font-style: italic;">The Shock Doctrine</span> by Naomi Klein right now and I feel like it's making me paranoid about everything.  However, I am also excited about Obama's presidency; I think he has some fantastic ideas and I think it's great how he wants to use the internet as a means of accessibility.  The past 8 years have not been very good for the U.S. or its image abroad and Obama's presidency definitely symbolizes a change in direction.  I am eager to see what he will do and what he will achieve, but I also have reservations about what will actually happen.  Call me a pessimist, call me a realist, call me what you like, but that's just how I see it.<br /><br />On a completely non-political note, what's up with Uggs??  I know I wrote about them before and how much I <span style="font-style: italic;">really, really, really</span> despise/hate/loathe them, but yesterday I went shopping with my dad and there were waaaaay too many people buying them or wearing them.  They're so fugly.  Why would anyone wear them?  If you have an answer, please, do explain.  Thanks.
