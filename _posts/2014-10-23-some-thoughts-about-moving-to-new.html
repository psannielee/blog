As I enjoy my last day in Düsseldorf, there are lots of thoughts going through my head. &nbsp;I remember the first time I moved abroad back in 2005 as a college student -- I actually sobbed to my mother for three hours. &nbsp;Maybe more. &nbsp;I recall wailing to her, "But why am I even going abroad?! &nbsp;I feel comfortable where I am and I <i>like</i> it here!! &nbsp;What am I <i>doing</i>?!?" &nbsp;Nine years later, eight of which have been spent outside the U.S., I can only laugh at my college self and think, "How cute." &nbsp;Because honestly, I wouldn't change the last nine years at all.<br /><br />I have the feeling that in Shanghai, I will constantly be comparing it to my German experience. &nbsp;I realize though that this is unfair. &nbsp;Düsseldorf consistently ranks in the top 10 most livable cities in Europe, if not the world, according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_Quality_of_Living_Survey" target="_blank">Mercer Quality of Living Survey</a>. &nbsp;On the other hand, China ranks as the number one country for expats according to the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20131122-an-expats-home-away-from-home" target="_blank">BBC</a>. &nbsp;But does living as an expat actually mean a good quality of life? &nbsp;I don't think it necessarily does, but this will probably be one of the bigger questions I answer in China.<br /><br />One thing that worries me about living in China is being Chinese-American, but my Mandarin is only so-so. &nbsp;Of course, I'm eager to improve it, but there is an expectation that if you look Asian, you speak the local language. &nbsp;It's a common problem in Asia that I encountered in Beijing, Tokyo, and Kyoto. &nbsp;The attitude is, "Why don't you speak the local language? &nbsp;You're Asian!" &nbsp;This video sums up my experience really well:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe align="middle" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oLt5qSm9U80" width="560"></iframe><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><div style="text-align: left;">I actually finished packing today and I must say, I'm either getting really good at this moving-abroad-for-a-year-thing or I'm forgetting something. &nbsp;(This is the third time I've moved abroad for a year -- once going to Berlin, once with my CBYX year) &nbsp;I managed to pack one big suitcase that weighs 19.6 kilograms (about 43 pounds) with everything I think I need in it. &nbsp;I've realized that I wear the same stuff over and over again anyway, so if the thought crossed my mind, "Maybe I should pack that because I might actually wear it," the item got left behind. &nbsp;This is what my clothing looked like just laying it out in the living room:<br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-acXV2rp29PA/VEfL70vVdII/AAAAAAAABQo/TZ56yrleiPM/s1600/WP_20141021_13_40_27_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-acXV2rp29PA/VEfL70vVdII/AAAAAAAABQo/TZ56yrleiPM/s1600/WP_20141021_13_40_27_Pro.jpg" height="225" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>Whenever it comes to larger trips like this (or rather, just moving temporarily), I take a look at what I want to bring. &nbsp;I considered actually making a chart of how many different combinations I could make -- which pants would go with what top and if I could match a jacket or cardigan to it, plus shoes. &nbsp;I didn't actually wind up making a chart, but I do take that into consideration. &nbsp;Anything that is too specific and can't be combined with anything else doesn't get packed. &nbsp;The only exception is a cocktail dress, which was the dead giveaway that I'm not a student anymore. &nbsp;I actually am bringing it because I thought, "Well, if I get invited to a wedding...or something...I don't feel like shopping." &nbsp;As a student, bringing a cocktail dress never even crossed my mind.<br /><br />After laying it out in the living room neatly, I rolled everything up. &nbsp;I find that rolling everything saves a lot more space and you can cram smaller things like t-shirts into gaps easier than when it's folded. &nbsp;Not only that, but I think my clothes also arrive less wrinkled when rolled. &nbsp;I could be wrong on this, but it's just a feeling. &nbsp;Anyhow, I can definitely fit more rolling everything and if I had actually packed my boots in the photo rather than wearing them, I would stuff them with clothes too. &nbsp;Plus, everything looks more manageable and less scary:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B0jXjtl4C_A/VEfL_2smsnI/AAAAAAAABQ0/3mIix6EFBsk/s1600/WP_20141021_19_55_38_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B0jXjtl4C_A/VEfL_2smsnI/AAAAAAAABQ0/3mIix6EFBsk/s1600/WP_20141021_19_55_38_Pro.jpg" height="225" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">With the shoes, I packed two pairs of heels, two pairs of boots, two pairs of casual shoes, and my running sneakers. &nbsp;The heels had to be versatile; I can wear them dressed for more formal occasions like putting them with the cocktail dress, but they also had to be not too flashy so I could wear them for work. &nbsp;The boots are very different from each other; as you can see, I have a pair of knee-highs and then ankle boots. &nbsp;Again, they're different from each other but can be worn with a lot of different outfits. &nbsp;As for the casual shoes, they don't take up much space, but I like having different pairs for city trips. &nbsp;And the running sneakers are for the gym (I don't run outside and can't imagine doing so in Shanghai). &nbsp;Generally, I took the largest items and decided that that's what I'll wear on the plane. &nbsp;So it's the knee-high boots, a hoodie, a pair of jeans, shirt, and leather jacket. &nbsp;It saves the space in my bag.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Finally, after I've evaluated everything rolled up, it all goes into the suitcase:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dLs-t-_a0vQ/VEfL_u2EIuI/AAAAAAAABQw/SovcUJu35fQ/s1600/WP_20141022_15_55_03_Pro.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dLs-t-_a0vQ/VEfL_u2EIuI/AAAAAAAABQw/SovcUJu35fQ/s1600/WP_20141022_15_55_03_Pro.jpg" height="225" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>Like I said, everything gets crammed into little spaces. &nbsp;Shoes are packed like they would be in a box so they're as narrow as possible. &nbsp;I've stuck a bunch of flat things in the front pockets of the luggage. &nbsp;Everything I packed managed to fit and then some, so I added one or two extra t-shirts, but left the extra sweaters out. &nbsp;If I were moving to a much colder place, I'd consider more warmer weather clothing, but considering I layer everything (tank tops/t-shirts with a sweater), it also makes everything more efficient.<br /><br />I started writing this yesterday, but now it's 6:45 in the morning. &nbsp;I woke up early so I know I'll be able to fall asleep on the plane. &nbsp;I could definitely use some more sleep, but I also had to make sure my carry-on and personal items are ready to go. &nbsp;And they are. &nbsp;So let's hope that I haven't forgotten anything super important. &nbsp;If I did, then it probably wasn't actually super important because I wouldn't have forgotten it in the first place.</div></div>
