Over the weekend I went to see Back to the Future with my sister Tracie and her fianc√© Wayne in a theater on the lower East Side. But after dinner, we had time to kill. We decided to walk over the Brooklyn Bridge, so when we were in Brooklyn, I took this picture of the Manhattan skyline. I love New York, and damn, I'm going to miss it when I'm in Berlin.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/1600/IMG_0516.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6217/910/320/IMG_0516.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Isn't it pretty?  I took it with my Canon SD400 Digital Elph and had to hold really still by placing it on a banister.  I also had to change the shutter speed.  I must say, it came out really nicely.
