Ok, so the title for this post might be a wee bit obvious.  However, it pertains to the fact that I hate it when there are a bunch of really tall guys (and girls!) standing in front of me at a concert.  I went to see the Kaiser Chiefs by myself and somehow, I wound up behind at least 10 people that were all 5 feet 10 inches or taller.  I thought perhaps that my observation two years ago at the Franz Ferdinand show was just nonsense because we got to the show late.  I thought, hmm, maybe all the tall guys are standing in the back because they're being courteous.  No, that isn't the case.  Germans are generally really tall, so it seems, or at least, the ones who always go to the shows that I go to.

<br />
To comment on the Kaiser Chiefs' performance, I must say, I was a bit disappointed in comparison to the last time I saw them.  However, this probably has to do with the fact that I saw them my first time at the Stone Pony and that has a capacity of 775 people.  The venue I saw them this time, E-Werk, has a capacity of 2,000 and I think the effect is that the lead singer did not have as much energy as in the smaller place.  Not to mention, I went to the show by myself, so that always has an effect on how I enjoy it.  Anyway, all that said and done, it was a very fun show from the aspect of the band and music.<br /><br />On the other hand, there were some really annoying people in my area.  If I were to make the rules for going to concerts, this is what they would be.  Call me mean, but damn, I'm coming up to my 50th concert, so I have some sort of backing to it.<br /><br />Concert-going Rules According to Me<br /><br />1.  Hey, tall people.  It'd be nice if you stood all together and let the shorter people in front of you.  I'm not necessarily saying that they should all stand in the back, but tall people should group together and fight it out which tall guy (or girl) gets to be in front of all of them.  Then all the people under 5' 10" can stand in front of the taller people.<br /><br />2.  Concerts are <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> a place to make out with your significant other.  I don't care if your special song is being played live.  It would be much appreciated if you did not make out and block my view or someone else's view.  Also, stop grabbing your significant other's butt/boob/hip/etc.  Think of it this way: It makes it that much easier for someone else to cop a feel.<br /><br />3.  If you have long hair and put it in a ponytail, be aware of what you do with it.  Even if it's not in a ponytail, be aware of what your long hair is doing.  I hate being at a show with a girl in front of me with long hair jumping around.  I do not like having your hair in my face.  How do I know you don't have lice or something crawling on your head?  Also, a mouthful of someone else's hair is just nasty in general.<br /><br />4.  If you can't jump or clap to the beat of the song, please stop jumping or clapping.  You're just going to screw up everyone else.  Plus, you're just going to look silly jumping/clapping on the 1 and 3 instead of the 2 and 4.  (If you know what I'm talking about, awesome.  If not, hopefully you just do it because jumping/clapping on the 1 and 3 is just unnatural.)  If the song is not in 4/4 time or you don't know what I'm talking about, just jump/clap to the downbeats and make it easy on yourself.  Yeah, thanks.<br /><br />5.  If you push/kick/shove/punch me, you are fair game to be pushed/kicked/shoved/punched back.  Simple as that.  Just because I am smaller does not necessarily mean I can't push/kick/shove/punch back.  Oh, and that goes for being a girl, as well.  Everyone is fair game in the mosh pit.<br /><br />6.  Stop staring at me because I am the only Asian (or oftentimes just plain non-Caucasian) there.  What's the big frickin' deal?<br /><br />But yes, for now, I think this is a good list of concert-going rules.<br /><br />Also, I'd like to comment on the fact that Germans <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">love</span> clapping.  I've noticed that quite often at concerts or on television.  Germans love clapping to the rhythm of the song, although tonight, there were a lot of people who didn't know how to keep a steady beat.  Christian and his sister commented on this, too, but honestly, Germans will clap to anything, whether it's a slow ballad, an upbeat dance theme, a loud rock song, or Volksmusik.  They will clap their hands off to <em>a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g</em>.  In the U.S., I feel like not so many people clap willingly.  I know I definitely went through a phase in life where I thought, "Wow, clapping to this song is an old people thing to do."  Maybe that's just me.  But seriously.  Germans.  Clap.  To.  Everything.
