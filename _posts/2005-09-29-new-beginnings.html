First off, Im going to apologize ahead for anz punctuation and what maz appear to be tzpos.  I'm on a German kezboard in an internet cafe, and well, I am trzing to maximiye mz time while Im here, rather than worrzing about punctuation and spelling and all that good stuff.<br /><br />Mz time in London went well, and seeing Ken and his friends and Chris was reallz great.  We went to a comedz club in Leicester Square, which was quite fun, and we got some pints to drink (This is England we're talking about).  We also went to a pub afterward, and I think the result of that night is prettz much a given of what happened!<br /><br />I also went to see Ewan McGregor in Guys and Dolls in the West End, and all I can saz is that it was FABULOUS.  I love the music and of course Ewan being in it helped a lot.  The worst part was probablz the imitated New York accents, but what can zou do?  I thought it ironic that I went to London to see a musical about New York...go figure!<br /><br />So as I said, I'm in an internet cafe with Alex sitting here next to me.  She is updating her blog too but she seems to keep typing and then deleting everzthing.  But anzwaz, I showed up in Tegel and thank goodness that Zoey and Alex were there, otherwise I would've had a major panic attack (which I had onlz a few dazs ago anzwaz).  We took the bus to the Zoologischer Garten, where Alex and I picked up a (Mercedes) cab and got to our B&B, which is actuallz in a residence.  <br /><br />Alex took a nap since she's been awake for a few hours (let's saz, 28 hours??), and then we left to walk around.  Funniest thing ever:  We walk outside and there, very close to where we are staying, was a car.  And not just anz car.  But this car had a MIDDLEBURY STICKER ON IT.  I know it's rude to type in all caps, but honestlz, what are the chances that we're here in Berlin, and a car has a Midd sticker on it?  I had to take a picture of it, and I promise I will post it when I get on mz own computer and all that.<br /><br />So how am I feeling through this whole experience thus far?  A few words:  Apprehensive.  Scared.  Nervous.  Doubtful.  And yes, mazbe even a little excited...but honestlz I think mz apprehension is overshadowing all other emotions.  I also feel like nobodz will understand me when I trz speaking in German because mz American accent is so thick, but granted that I will be here for a zear, mz German SHOULD be getting better.<br /><br />Oh, and first impressions of Berlin:<br /><br />1.  The weather is worse than London.  Whz?  Well, I show up in London expecting prettz bad weather, but it was prettz decent.  I show up here and its cold and raining, which causes everzthing to be this graz color.  Mazbe it has something to do with how I feel.<br /><br />II.  There are ridiculous amounts of H&Ms.  Alex and I saw what...4 in a row?  We were thinking that thez were possiblz the same building, but no, thez weren't.  Thez were seperate H&Ms on perhaps 2 blocks.  What the heck do zou need all the H&Ms for?<br /><br />c.  It seems like everzone loves their pizza.  Alex and I have found numerous pizzerias.  We haven't eaten any....yet.<br /><br />Four.  Considering that I've onlz been here for 8 hours, I don't think I can actuallz have a fourth observation.  Especiallz because we haven't reallz walked around that much...we went through a bunch of residential neighborhoods.<br /><br />Oh, but I do have to say, it will take me awhile to get used to people being able to smoke just about everywhere.  So just as a warning to any family members reading this:  I'm probablz going to come home smelling like cigarettes, the way Tzeh did when she came home from Florence.  <br /><br />So, for now...I guess I'll be ok.  I'm hoping to buy a cell phone within the next two days (I'm going to ask Zoey for help), and hopefullz I will find an apartment within the next 6.  I'm not forcing mzself to find anzthing in this time period, because I realiye that will just make things harder.  All I reallz need is a good location, internet, a kitchen, and a bed.  Not too difficult, I don't think.<br /><br />So I guess that's it for this edition of mz adventures in Berlin.  Perhaps the next time I write I will have mz own place bz then..........
