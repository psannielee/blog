As much as I consider myself a pop culture fanatic, I also get into TV shows considerably later than everyone else. &nbsp;Consider that I got into <i>Lost</i>, <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>, and <i>Mad Men</i> after their second seasons had already aired and finished on TV. &nbsp;And I'll admit it -- I have never seen an episode of <i>Breaking Bad </i>or<i> Downtown Abbey,&nbsp;</i>watched only two episodes of <i>The Walking Dead </i>(which I liked), and only started watching <i>30 Rock</i> in earnest this year, which is a shame because it is simply hilarious.<br /><div><br /></div><div>And then there's <i>Game of Thrones</i>. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_0lvOE4cCsc/U1GKWwiEMXI/AAAAAAAAA9A/xXI8dpEwDpA/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-04-18+at+10.25.18+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_0lvOE4cCsc/U1GKWwiEMXI/AAAAAAAAA9A/xXI8dpEwDpA/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-04-18+at+10.25.18+PM.png" height="187" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I only read the books because my husband had gone through all of them and had only praise. &nbsp;It took me a really long time to get through the books that are out. &nbsp;My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/576634587" target="_blank">first impression</a> was not that enthusiastic and after reading the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/719731651" target="_blank">fifth book</a>, I still haven't warmed to the series.</div><div><br /></div><div>As for the show, I had watched a few episodes and again, was not super excited to watch it. &nbsp;In fact, I kept having the tendency of falling asleep. &nbsp;"But how?!" you scream. &nbsp;It took me a really long to stop falling asleep while watching <i>The Godfather </i>and realize how brilliant of a film that is, so maybe this the same.</div><div></div><div><br /></div><div>However, I'm forcing myself to watch this season because I've already read the books. &nbsp;More importantly, it's for the water cooler talk. &nbsp;God, I can't escape it. &nbsp;Even though season four is only two episodes in, it's <u><i>everywhere</i></u>. &nbsp;I can't be the annoying person that asks, "So, did that happen in the latest episode? &nbsp;Oh, did I just spoil something? &nbsp;Uh, sorry." &nbsp;Because that's what will inevitably happen and has happened for the past two weeks. &nbsp;True, I could just read the reviews for experts on <a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/game-of-thrones-experts/" target="_blank">The AV Club</a> and that would save me the hour of watching the show, but then I feel like I'm raining on everyone's parade.<br /><br />(Stop reading here if you don't want to read any spoilers. &nbsp;I mean it. &nbsp;I'm bringing in stuff from the books.)</div><div><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div>I suppose this season of <i>Game of Thrones</i> will also be my favorite considering I liked the third book the most. &nbsp;Aaaaaaand spoiler alert -- there's lots of deaths. &nbsp;Is it weird that I'm looking forward to them? &nbsp;Joffrey's death in the second episode of season four was one of those, "Hell yeah!" TV moments. &nbsp;I was wondering if that would happen in the first episodes, and I'm glad that the writers hadn't pushed it towards later in the season. &nbsp;I also can't wait for Tywin and Shae to die and see Peter Dinklage's acting in that particular scene. &nbsp;He has added a lot of subtlety to the character that is probably one of the main reasons that I haven't said, "Screw the water cooler talk" yet.</div><div><br /></div><div>With only ten episodes per season, I will probably be watching it, but <i>Game of Thrones</i> definitely has lower priority than <i>Mad Men</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>On a related note, <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/professor-suspended-game-thrones-shirt-threatened--203579" target="_blank">this article</a> about a professor at a community college near my hometown who was arrested because, as the AV Club put it, his shirt "threatened community college kingdom," makes me cringe. &nbsp;I so don't want to be that person who doesn't get really obvious pop culture references.</div>
