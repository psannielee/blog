<p>As much as I consider myself a pop culture fanatic, I also get into TV shows considerably later than everyone else. Consider that I got into <em>Lost</em>, <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>, and <em>Mad Men</em> after their second seasons had already aired and finished on TV. And I'll admit it -- I have never seen an episode of <em>Breaking Bad </em>or<em> Downtown Abbey,</em>watched only two episodes of <em>The Walking Dead </em>(which I liked), and only started watching <em>30 Rock</em> in earnest this year, which is a shame because it is simply hilarious.
</p>
<p>And then there's <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>

<p>
I only read the books because my husband had gone through all of them and had only praise. It took me a really long time to get through the books that are out. My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/576634587" target="_blank">first impression</a> was not that enthusiastic and after reading the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/719731651" target="_blank">fifth book</a>, I still haven't warmed to the series.
</p>
<p>As for the show, I had watched a few episodes and again, was not super excited to watch it. In fact, I kept having the tendency of falling asleep. "But how?!" you scream. It took me a really long to stop falling asleep while watching <em>The Godfather </em>and realize how brilliant of a film that is, so maybe this the same.
</p>
<p>However, I'm forcing myself to watch this season because I've already read the books. More importantly, it's for the water cooler talk. God, I can't escape it. Even though season four is only two episodes in, it's <u><em>everywhere</em></u>. I can't be the annoying person that asks, "So, did that happen in the latest episode? Oh, did I just spoil something? Uh, sorry." Because that's what will inevitably happen and has happened for the past two weeks. True, I could just read the reviews for experts on <a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/game-of-thrones-experts/" target="_blank">The AV Club</a> and that would save me the hour of watching the show, but then I feel like I'm raining on everyone's parade.
</p>
<p>(Stop reading here if you don't want to read any spoilers. I mean it. I'm bringing in stuff from the books.)
</p>
<p>
I suppose this season of <em>Game of Thrones</em> will also be my favorite considering I liked the third book the most. Aaaaaaand spoiler alert -- there's lots of deaths. Is it weird that I'm looking forward to them? Joffrey's death in the second episode of season four was one of those, "Hell yeah!" TV moments. I was wondering if that would happen in the first episodes, and I'm glad that the writers hadn't pushed it towards later in the season. I also can't wait for Tywin and Shae to die and see Peter Dinklage's acting in that particular scene. He has added a lot of subtlety to the character that is probably one of the main reasons that I haven't said, "Screw the water cooler talk" yet.
</p>
<p>
With only ten episodes per season, I will probably be watching it, but <em>Game of Thrones</em> definitely has lower priority than <em>Mad Men</em>.

On a related note, <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/professor-suspended-game-thrones-shirt-threatened--203579" target="_blank">this article</a> about a professor at a community college near my hometown who was arrested because, as the AV Club put it, his shirt "threatened community college kingdom," makes me cringe. I so don't want to be that person who doesn't get really obvious pop culture references.
