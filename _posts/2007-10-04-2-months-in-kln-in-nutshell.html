It's been a long time since the last time I updated due to a lack of internet.  However, I moved out of my host mom's place and moved into a shared apartment (WG) where I have two 28-year-old German roommates, Volker and Stefanie.  Both seem to be really friendly and do their own things (I hardly see Volker), so I've been cooking for myself.<br /><br />Although I've moved into a WG, it's a bit sad because it marked almost everyone else's move from Köln to their permanent placements.  The only people left here in Köln are Daniel, Greg, Jason, Aldous, and me, which I think actually makes up a really good group.  However, there are other people who are not too far away, like those also in Nordrhein-Westfalen, Mainz, Wiesbaden, and Frankfurt.  Hopefully I will be able to see those people once in awhile.<br /><br />The past two months flew by and a lot happened.  In order to condense everything so you can read it if you want to or skip over it, I'm writing a commentated list:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.  People had birthdays and a few of us discovered a jazz club. </span> I don't have any pictures from Lara's birthday because Daniel, Kari, and I had no desire dealing with a large group and bounced.  However, I do have photos from Justus and John's join celebration in Flanagan's (this Irish bar that caters to the international student population).  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1060/1484858177_d6dbee4f15.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 262px; height: 195px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1060/1484858177_d6dbee4f15.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>However, Megan, Daniel, Greg, and I wanted to go to a jazz bar we had seen, so we did and had a really great time. The mood was perfect, the music was fun, and the beer pricey but worth it because the money went towards the musicians.  We went another time and saw and old man from our language school who wound up buying us a round of beer and CDs from the performing group.  I had heard from my teacher that the old man smoked cigars, so Greg ran out and got some to smoke with him.  It turned out that the old man had quit smoking cigars two months previously.  My face turned red not from beer but from embarrassment that I had been the one to suggest getting cigars.  (How was I supposed to know?!)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.  Nine of us went to a friendly soccer match, Germany versus Romania. </span> It was really fun even though we had seats stuck up in the corner and it was pretty much the B-team playing.  We got to hear this cheesy song, "Viva Colonia" multiple times.  This song is for the local Kölner soccer team, 1. FC Köln, but they played it at the national team game anyway.  Who cares?  Besides which, Lukas Podolski used to play for FC Köln.  I managed to guess the outcome of the game correct; Germany won 3 to 1.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1149/1485671848_ca4984fb6b.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1149/1485671848_ca4984fb6b.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.  We all finished two months of "intensive" language courses and took tests for them.  </span>Pat and I had been in Level 8 in August, but passed the test at the end to move up to the next level.  However, the Oberstufe (advanced class) consisted of people in Level 9 and 10, so we just did Level 10 stuff.  In essence, Pat and I skipped a Stufe.  ("Jaaaa!" is what Pat would always say)  Now we can say we're supposedly fluent in German because we passed the Oberstufe exam.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.  I went to Brühl and Bonn on separate occasions.</span>  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1252/1484870335_c86d0b737a.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 283px; height: 213px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1252/1484870335_c86d0b737a.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Daniel, this Korean girl from Tajikistan (Tajik?) in our class Lena, and I wanted to go see the Schloss in Brühl, but unfortunately the Deutsche Bank was holding an event there, so we couldn't go.  Then our class went to Bonn on an excursion to the Haus der Geschichte (House of History) and the Beethoven Haus.  It was really interesting and I will have to go back to the Haus der Geschichte.  Daniel and I now have a joke that whenever we're in Bonn (or more like whenever Daniel is in Bonn), we're partying with Beethoven.  (Daniel wants to do orchestral conducting and likes classical music, so it makes sense....Party mit Beethoven!)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.  I went to Berlin twice to visit Christian and we saw Wir Sind Helden. </span> While in Berlin, I also saw Andrea once, but managed to miss Devin somehow.  It was surreal being with Andrea in a smoky club in Berlin, but it was definitely fun.  As for seeing Wir Sind Helden,<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1375/1485701856_88ffeea76b.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 248px; height: 193px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1375/1485701856_88ffeea76b.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> they were really good and I enjoyed them, but I don't think I'd pay to go see them again.  They played a lot of their mellow songs, which are nice to listen to when I'm at home chilling, but when I'm at a concert, I want to dance.  Or jump.  Or mosh.  Ok, admittedly, everyone was jumping in sync when Wir Sind Helden played "Denkmal," but that was strange.  Best songs of the night had to be "Heldenzeit," "Nur Ein Wort," and "Guten Tag."  Well, I suppose "Endlich Ein Grund zur Panik" was good, too...any time the horn players got some good time was pretty much kick ass.<br /><br />So that pretty much sums up the last two months.  I actually updated <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sannielee">my Flickr page</a> as well, so there's a whole bunch of new pictures up if you want to see them.  Hopefully I will be updating this a little more regularly, now that I have regular access to the internet.
