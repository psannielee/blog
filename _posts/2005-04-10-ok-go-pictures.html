My friend emailed me the pictures from the OK Go show we went to on March 29th at Higher Ground in Burlington. I must say, it was a really fun show and it was good see OK Go again. If you ever get a chance to see them, definitely do it. They care about their fans and actually interact with them. All around, just plain <span style="font-style: italic;">friendly</span>.  And <span style="font-weight: bold;">FUN</span>.<br /><br />Oh, and the reason why there are so many pics of Damian is because we were standing right in front of him.  I didn't take the pictures.  My friend did.  So you can ask him why there aren't any pictures of Andy, Tim, or Dan.<br /><br /><img src="http://photos8.flickr.com/8931550_e6d22595b6_m.jpg" /><br /><img src="http://photos6.flickr.com/8931389_17ef134139_m.jpg" />  <img src="http://photos4.flickr.com/8931390_a54126af4d_m.jpg" /><br /><img src="http://photos8.flickr.com/8931391_5da6b3a639_m.jpg" />  <img src="http://photos4.flickr.com/8931392_3175c62d4b_m.jpg" /><br /><img src="http://photos6.flickr.com/8931393_6286984bbb_m.jpg" />  <img src="http://photos5.flickr.com/8931394_cab6277b78_m.jpg" />  <img src="http://photos5.flickr.com/8931551_8b99e6fb2c_m.jpg" /><br /><img src="http://photos6.flickr.com/8931552_3eb6d5167a_m.jpg" />  <img src="http://photos5.flickr.com/8931553_d7ac5bd415_m.jpg" />
