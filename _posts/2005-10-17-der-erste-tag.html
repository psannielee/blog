I survived.  The first day of classes.  Well, ok, it was one classÂ´about the French Revolution.  I probably will not even take it because I will most likely end up taking more film courses.  The professor was really nice and the class already has a 10 page paper built into it already (Hausarbeit), so it's not a problem that I will have to write 12 pages (of course, depending on if I take the course). <br /><br />Before the class started, I was unbelievably nervous.  My hands were shaking and I just kept reminding myself to breathe.  I mean, I know it's just another class, but it's in another language.  The first thing the professor asked was "Was ist politische Kultur?"  I could possibly explain myself in English, but in German?  Good question.  Was IST politische Kultur?  Got me...in German.<br /><br />The class felt very much like a discussion class back at Middlebury:  There wasn't more than 12 students, we sat around desks set up in a large square, and the professor was laid back and sitting, too.  What the professor talked about mostly was a very brief introduction to the course and just answering his one question of "Was ist politische Kultur."  I was surprised at the amount that I understood and as forgetful as I am out of nerves, I had forgotten my English-German pocket dictionary, so it was even better than I thought.  Out of the entire class, there were only 3 international students including myself.  The other two were two French guys (the only reason why I knew was because they whipped out a French-German dictionary that had a large French flag on it) who I am sure know a lot about the Revolution.  Maybe.<br /><br />After the class, I had to approach the professor and ask him if it was ok that I write a 12 page paper instead of a 10, introduce myself, and tell him that I am with the Middlebury program.  I was so nervous that I used the informal you form (du instead of Sie), which I was later kicking myself for.  I asked him if he was familiar with the Midd program and he just sort of gave me this look, then asked, "Is that in Vermont, between the mountains and in the really pretty valley?"  Apparently he was there last summer.  Perhaps with the Language Schools, I didn't ask.  He was very nice and didn't seemed fazed that I used the wrong "you" form (Thank God, otherwise I would definitely NOT take the class).<br /><br />So hurrah, the first day is over.  It's always the hardest.  Tomorrow I have three classes to go to: 2 film ones (both are taught by the same woman) and 1 history one (which I'm excited about the title: "Comics in History - History in Comics?").  No idea what ones I will take, but regardless, I am glad that the first day is over.<br /><br />Oh, and for the Fair Lawn people reading my blog...I just heard that a certain Vicky from the class of 2003 has become a stripper.  With her best friend that is a year younger than us.  I'm not giving specific names, just in case this is googled or something.  All I can say is I can't wait til 5 year reunion.
