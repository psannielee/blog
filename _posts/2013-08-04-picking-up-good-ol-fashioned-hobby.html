Although I dedicate this blog mostly to thinking about pop culture, I have to write about a new hobby I recently picked up.&nbsp; Last year for Christmas, I got a fairly large present.&nbsp; When it was wrapped up, I thought it was a Wii and got really excited.&nbsp; It turned out to be a sewing machine.&nbsp; "A sewing machine?" you ask.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I had been saying for awhile that I wanted to learn how to sew to be self-sufficient.&nbsp; Not only that, I have often gone into stores, found something I like and one of the following things happened:<br /><ul><li>The fit sucked but looked nice on a hanger.</li><li>I didn't like the material but I like the cut.</li><li>I liked something and it fit, but it was too expensive.</li><li>I liked something but the quality was crap.</li><li>I found something secondhand that was just too big.</li></ul>....you get the point.<br /><br />Sewing seems to be one of those things that our grandmothers had learned out of necessity, but our mothers scorned it when they burned their bras and demanded gender equality.&nbsp; Why stay at home and learn to sew when there's a whole world out there to conquer?<br /><br />But in this day and age, the choice to sew is much like any other choice a woman makes.&nbsp; It's the freedom to choose what to do, right?<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br />I bought a secondhand dress in Berlin back in February in anticipation of learning how to sew.&nbsp; On me, it looked like a tent since it was about 5 sizes too big.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iqhT-_gVDH0/Uf5a3cXoHmI/AAAAAAAAAy4/sGHjU-XFTik/s1600/IMG_2255.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iqhT-_gVDH0/Uf5a3cXoHmI/AAAAAAAAAy4/sGHjU-XFTik/s1600/IMG_2255.JPG" height="320" width="213" /></a> If you look, it also had these hideous ruffles at the neckline and the sleeves were a bit poofy and again, just too big.&nbsp; You can't see it in the picture, but there was also some material to tie into a bow or something.&nbsp; All in all, not exactly a perfect dress.<br /><br />Although I didn't know how to sew yet, I thought the dress had potential.&nbsp; Maybe take the sleeves off or turn them into cap sleeves.&nbsp; Shorten the hemline.&nbsp; Bring it in to my own size.&nbsp; How hard could it be?<br /><br />I discovered a sewing shop around the corner from where I live and I had three friends with sewing machines who also wanted to learn.&nbsp; Who would've thought this was a thing?&nbsp; I asked the shop owner if she would give us a private workshop and teach us how to sew, so we spent a Sunday afternoon learning by doing.&nbsp; We picked out materials in the store and sewed it together to make a top.&nbsp; It was pretty cool being able to create something unique from a bolt of fabric.&nbsp; Although I was super psyched about making my own shirt, the shop owner had helped me <b>a lot</b>.&nbsp; I basically learned how to thread the sewing machine, the different parts of it, different tools needed when sewing, and the basics.&nbsp; And I picked up some new German words on the way: <i>Oberfadenspannung </i>(needle thread tension), <i>Stichmusterwahlknopf </i>(the knob where you choose your stitching pattern).&nbsp; Oh, Deutsch!&nbsp; I also discovered sewing in a straight line is way harder than you think.<br /><br />My next project was to make a dinosaur-patterned tank top.&nbsp; I had seen the material in the store and thought it was pretty fun, even if it was geared towards children.&nbsp; I looked online how to make a pattern, vaguely understood it, and made my own pattern from a tank top I like.&nbsp; It took me awhile and sure, the different lines where the fabric comes together didn't quite match up, but, success!&nbsp; I started learning how to sew in a straight line.<br /><br />I finally decided I should try making that secondhand Berlin dress smaller.&nbsp; I tried following <a href="http://jezebel.com/5815251/how-to-alter-a-thrift-store-dress" target="_blank">a tutorial on Jezebel</a>, but didn't have the patience to read through the whole thing while sewing.&nbsp; I basically just started pinning the dress here and there and had way too much ripping out the ruffles.&nbsp; (Seriously, taking out material is a great way to let frustration out and is almost as satisfying as hitting the gym.&nbsp; "Take that, you stupid ruffle!")&nbsp; I kept being afraid I would screw up, but hey, the dress had only cost me 2.50â‚¬.&nbsp; It took a few tries, but this is what the end product looks like:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5ZQsX_iEwbo/Uf5gpw_yI7I/AAAAAAAAAzI/-KNMtaMKaSQ/s1600/Photo+on+8-4-13+at+3.09+PM.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5ZQsX_iEwbo/Uf5gpw_yI7I/AAAAAAAAAzI/-KNMtaMKaSQ/s1600/Photo+on+8-4-13+at+3.09+PM.jpg" height="213" width="320" /></a></div><br />It's not quite perfect and there's still room for improvement, but I'm getting better at sewing in a straight line.<br /><br />The funny thing about learning how to sew is that I've discovered how calming it can be.&nbsp; I sit there and concentrate so that I actually can block out anything else that I would normally think about.&nbsp; It might seem like an old-fashioned thing to do, but at the same time, it has a soothing effect that helps with all the modern-day stress.&nbsp; I'm not nearly at a point where I am confident enough and could sew anything for anyone, but it's definitely something I think I will continue to do, if not to actually create cool things, but to just sort of relax a little bit and feel like I'm being self-sufficient.&nbsp; <br /><br />
