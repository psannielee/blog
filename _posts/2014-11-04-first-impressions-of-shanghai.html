I've been in Shanghai for a little over a week now. &nbsp;I haven't even scratched the surface of this enormous city, but I do have my first five impressions. &nbsp;So here they are:<br /><br /><b>1. &nbsp;Shanghai is like living in the future. &nbsp;</b><br /><br />Or Blade Runner. &nbsp;Seriously. &nbsp;This is what the city looks like on a beautiful sunny day fairly free of smog:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EzM1XBAguHo/VFjXqpQCp5I/AAAAAAAABT0/9i0dXfzi8xU/s1600/pudong2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EzM1XBAguHo/VFjXqpQCp5I/AAAAAAAABT0/9i0dXfzi8xU/s1600/pudong2.jpg" height="225" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>The skyscrapers are so high, and everything is just so futuristic and <i>shiny</i>. &nbsp;The Oriental Pearl Tower (the TV tower thing on the left side of the photo) sort of reminds me of what Disneyworld thinks the future should be like in Tomorrowland. &nbsp;If you don't know what I mean, take a look at <a href="https://flic.kr/p/6aQk9q" target="_blank">this picture</a> I took in 2009 from Hong Kong Disney's Tomorrowland. &nbsp;The Oriental Pearl Tower totally belongs in that weird idea of the future. &nbsp;Next time I get around to taking a picture of the city at night, I'll be sure to post it since I'm positive it will definitely look like Blade Runner.<br /><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><b>2. &nbsp;Shanghai is vast.</b><br /><br />OK, this might be because I'm used to living in tiny little Düsseldorf. &nbsp;But the amount of time it takes me to take a regional train from Düsseldorf to Cologne is about the same time I need <i>just on the subway</i> to get across town. &nbsp;And it's about just as far! &nbsp;I had to go from the Pudong (eastern side of the river) to the Puxi side near the Shanghai Zoo for a health check. &nbsp;It took me over an hour to get there with the subway and had I taken a cab, probably would've needed just about the same because of traffic.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Tvu582wEl54/VFi4g2wnSxI/AAAAAAAABTU/-VRj8Cpy5Qg/s1600/puxi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Tvu582wEl54/VFi4g2wnSxI/AAAAAAAABTU/-VRj8Cpy5Qg/s1600/puxi.jpg" height="225" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Speaking of the health check, this brings me to the next point:<br /><br /><b>3. &nbsp;You think Germans are efficient? &nbsp;You obviously have not been to China.</b><br /><br />Germans are not necessarily efficient, but precise. &nbsp;Anyone who has experienced German bureaucracy knows it's painful. &nbsp;It consists of going to whatever office (like the aliens' office) and parking your ass on a chair for about three hours before you're called to the front of the line, only to discover you've just waited to make another appointment for the future. &nbsp;You could've saved this time had you called in advance and gotten lucky that they answered your call. &nbsp;That's German bureaucracy.<br /><br />Chinese bureaucracy? &nbsp;My first experience was doing the health check, so I went to this little health center out near the Shanghai Zoo. &nbsp;It's full of foreigners who want to work here. &nbsp;You fill out some paperwork, get called into a room where they asked me if I was pregnant (no), and then said, "Room 113, please." &nbsp;You go into Room 113, have your height and weight measured, get handed a cotton robe to change into and a key to a locker for your belongings, and then get told what room is next. &nbsp;And it just keeps going like that, but with extreme efficiency. &nbsp;Each room was for a specific test -- figuring out your pulse, blood work, x-rays, etc. &nbsp;And everyone just sits patiently in a line and it <i>moves</i>. &nbsp;Each doctor in each room just does what they need to do, no questions asked, done. <br /><br />I was in the line after an Indian woman about my age, a Frenchman, and an American woman was behind me. &nbsp;There were also some Indian men, a Japanese woman, and a Taiwanese man, amongst several other people. &nbsp;We were all bewildered and impressed at how efficient the whole process was. &nbsp;I probably got the most thorough health check in my life and it took at most an hour. &nbsp;Supposedly the process can take longer on busier days, but even so, it was faster than anything I've experienced in Germany in terms of bureaucracy. &nbsp;The only problem I encountered was that the nurse/doctor who was taking blood couldn't find a vein in my left arm unlike everyone else. &nbsp;You could see she was slightly annoyed, but she managed to find one anyway.<br /><br />Conclusion: China is more efficient than Germany. &nbsp;We'll see if that impression remains.<br /><br /><b>4. &nbsp;I confuse the hell out of everyone because of my language (in)abilities.</b><br /><br />This one just makes me laugh. &nbsp;I knew I would have some difficulties starting out because I never use my Mandarin. &nbsp;My Cantonese is a lot better, but the problem is that whenever I want to say something in Mandarin, I resort to Cantonese. &nbsp;A great example is when I went to the drugstore the other day to buy some face wash. &nbsp;I don't how to say "face," "wash," or "soap" in Mandarin, so when the sales lady asked me what I wanted, I sort of made the motion of washing my face and said, "Wash face," in Cantonese. &nbsp;Then because all skin products here have a whitening agent due to beauty standards, I added in Mandarin, "I don't want white!" &nbsp;How you say "whitening agent" in Cantonese or Mandarin is beyond me. &nbsp;To say the least, the sales lady was a bit confused.<br /><br />Apparently people also give me quizzical looks when I talk to Christian in the street in German. &nbsp;I had to giggle with my friend Ningxin, whom I met in Germany and speak German with, because we noticed people raising eyebrows. &nbsp;We thought people might think we're Vietnamese since they wouldn't really recognize German, but we're two Asians conversing.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6A7fnSN705I/VFitdEUZjpI/AAAAAAAABS4/_A0cms6wVLM/s1600/with_ningxin.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6A7fnSN705I/VFitdEUZjpI/AAAAAAAABS4/_A0cms6wVLM/s1600/with_ningxin.jpg" height="225" width="400" /></a></div><br />Then again, confusing people with what language I can speak is sort of my life anyway and has been for at least the last eight years. &nbsp;People in Germany always look shocked when I speak German fluently. &nbsp;Maybe not so much in Düsseldorf since there are so many Japanese people around, but I've definitely experienced this surprise firsthand. &nbsp;It comes down to the fact that the expectations are completely different -- in Europe, the expectation is, "You don't have to speak my language because you don't look like me." &nbsp;In Asia, the expectation is, "You should speak my language because you look like me." &nbsp;I think this is a topic that will come up over and over again, but I'll devote another blog entry to it at some point in the future.<br /><br />However, I've been learning words really quickly and every day I care less about weirding people out. &nbsp;I just point to what I want to order and say, "I want one of these," or politely explain that I don't know what they're saying when they speak too quickly. &nbsp;Just listening to it, seeing it, hearing it, and trying to speak it every day is letting me make improvements I never would otherwise make.<br /><br /><b>5. &nbsp;Food is cheap and plentiful.</b><br /><br />Going hand-in-hand with this observation, I'm going to say this now -- I think I'm going to gain weight this year. &nbsp;There's just so much delicious food everywhere and it's cheap!<br /><br />I haven't gotten sick of eating Chinese food every day for every meal yet. &nbsp;We'll see how long it takes. &nbsp;After two weeks in India and eating Indian food for every meal that whole time, I couldn't eat Indian food for five months afterward. &nbsp;Actually, I haven't even really eaten Indian food since then. &nbsp;So, we'll see how it goes with Chinese food. &nbsp;But here's some hot pot for you to drool over:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PXA0Xb2oFiI/VFitTt_MTOI/AAAAAAAABSw/a-Uq5yeSSBk/s1600/food.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PXA0Xb2oFiI/VFitTt_MTOI/AAAAAAAABSw/a-Uq5yeSSBk/s1600/food.jpg" height="225" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">My last thought about my first impressions is that it's interesting what sorts of things I'm looking for now as an adult seeking employment versus a student fresh in Berlin. &nbsp;For one, I know I wouldn't be able to live off döner if I moved to Germany now or the Chinese equivalent. &nbsp;While walking around the neighborhood that Christian and I will be moving to this weekend, I was excited about the fact that there's an organic supermarket nearby. &nbsp;Yup, student me wouldn't have cared so much. &nbsp;Adult me got really excited. &nbsp;How things change.</div>
