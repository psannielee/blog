So today is my fourth day here searching for an apartment or "Wohngemeinschaft" (WG) in an internet cafe.  I feel as if Alex, Zilai, and I are just living here.  I think we stay here for about 4 hours or more per day, emailing, calling, and running around the city to see various places.  I am starting to get accustomed to the keyboard here (like remembering the y and z are switched on it from the U.S.), but even so, I still make some mistakes.<br /><br />The weather is still basically cloudy.  I don't understand it, but it seems like Berlin really does have worse weather than London.  Didn't think it possible.<br /><br />One other observation I've made is that nobody here jay walks, as in, everywhere is clear, but the Germans wait until the pedestrian signal goes green.  I've jaywalked (I'm from the NYC area, what do you want!) and gotten heads shaken at me.  I guess everyone is not nearly in as big of a rush as they are back home, but even so, it will take some time to get used to.<br /><br />Today is actually a national holiday here: Der Tag der Einheit Deutschlands.  15 years ago today the two Germanys were reunited into one nation.  I heard from our host that there might be stuff going on by the Brandenburg Gate, such as beer drinking (surprise, surprise) and eating (wurst, perhaps?).  I think we may try to go over there later after some appointments.<br /><br />Other than that, there really isn't so much to say.  The 4 places I saw yesterday were really nice and the people are friendly.  Two of those places spoke in English with me (well, actually, one of them we spoke in English, German, and Spanish in one period of time!), and the others were completely in German.  It is still a process, but I am sure it will sink in in a few weeks.<br /><br />The car with the Midd sticker still hasn't seen our note yet.  It's been sitting there since...Friday?
